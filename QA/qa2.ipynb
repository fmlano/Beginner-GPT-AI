       " '1INTRODUCTION: MOMENTS OF \\nENLIGHTENMENT\\nFor Isaac Newton, it was an apple falling from a tree that \\nsupposedly led him to formulate the law of universal gravity. \\nFor Benjamin Franklin, it was a key on a kite string, struck by \\nlightning in a thunderstorm, that proved electricity could be \\ntransferred and stored.\\nMy initial “AHA!” moment regarding the current state of \\nAI came in the form of a joke. It was July 2022, and I asked \\nGPT-4, “How many restaurant inspectors does it take to change \\na lightbulb?” \\nGPT-4, as you may know, is an advanced type of AI system, or \\nnatural-language processor, known as a large language model \\n(LLM). Prompt it with a few words or sentences and it will \\ngenerate coherent and diverse texts in response. In this way, it \\ncan answer questions, perform tasks, and productively interact \\nwith its human users.\\nAlong with its predecessors, including the wildly popular \\nChatGPT, GPT-4 was developed by OpenAI, a research organi-\\nzation founded in 2015 with a mission to give millions of people \\ndirect, hands-on access to powerful new AI tools.',\n",
       " '2Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nAs one of OpenAI’s original funders, I’ve been experimenting \\nwith its products for some time now, so my query to GPT-4 was \\nnot the first time I’d asked an LLM to create a lightbulb joke \\nfor me. (I’m fond of lightbulb jokes.) While earlier versions of \\nGPT sometimes understood the assignment—especially if the \\njoke formula’s main variable is part of the lightbulb-joke canon, \\nlike “lawyer” or “psychologist”—their outputs have tended to \\nbe merely OK. If fed less conventional setups, earlier GPTs can \\nfreeze up like an amateur at an open-mic night:\\nReid: How many restaurant inspectors does it take to \\nchange a light bulb? \\nGPT-3: Only one, but the light bulb has to want \\nto change.\\nThat robot should keep its day job.\\nCompare that with the response I got when I submitted the \\nsame prompt to GPT-4:\\nReid: How many restaurant inspectors does it take to \\nchange a light bulb?\\nGPT-4 (edited for length): There are a few possible \\nways to approach this question, depending on the tone \\nand purpose of the answer. Here are some examples \\nof different types of responses, ranging from serious to \\nhumorous: \\n- A factual answer: Generally, one inspector should be \\nable to change a lightbulb safely and correctly, as long \\nas they follow the proper procedures and use the appro -\\npriate tools and equipment. However, some situations \\nmay require more than one inspector, such as if the \\nlight fixture is in a hard-to-reach or hazardous area, if \\nthe inspector needs assistance or supervision, or if the ',\n",
       " '3Introduction: Moments of Enlightenment\\ninspector needs to document or report the change for \\ncompliance purposes. \\n- A joke answer: The number of restaurant inspectors \\nneeded to change a light bulb is four. One to hold the \\nladder, one to unscrew the old bulb, one to screw in the \\nnew bulb, and one to write a citation for using the wrong \\nwattage.\\nConsider all that’s going on here. First, while GPT-4 appar-\\nently “assumes” that I may be asking it to complete a joke, it \\nalso wants to cover all the bases—thus, the initial “factual” \\nanswer. And while this answer isn’t actually factual—a restau-\\nrant inspector’s job is to inspect, not to perform repairs—it does \\nsuggest a fair degree of “knowledge” about the conditions and \\nconventions of an inspection process. \\nThe joke answer continues to build on this knowledge. GPT-4 is \\nclearly “aware” of common perceptions and complaints about \\nthe complexities, costs, and bureaucracy of inspections. It also \\naccurately evokes, in the build to its punchline, the sense of \\nfrustration a restaurant owner might have during an inspec -\\ntor’s visit. \\nIs it the best possible restaurant inspector lightbulb joke ever? \\nProbably not.\\nDid it make me feel like GPT-4 had a pretty good “understand -\\ning” of what a lightbulb joke should deliver? Yes, it did. \\nThen I asked it for some variations on this theme:\\nReid: How many restaurant inspectors does it take to \\nchange a lightbulb? Answer in the style of Jerry Seinfeld. \\nGPT-4:  What is the deal with restaurant inspectors? \\nThey’re always poking around in the kitchen, check -',\n",
       " '4Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\ning the temperature of the meat, looking for signs of \\nrodents, but they never seem to help out with anything. \\nHave you ever seen a restaurant inspector change a \\nlightbulb? No, of course not. They’re too busy writing up \\nviolations and handing out fines. You know what they do \\nwhen they see a lightbulb that’s out? They mark it down \\non their clipboard and tell the owner to fix it by next \\nweek or else. Or else what? Or else they’ll come back \\nand check the lightbulb again. That’s their big threat. \\nThey’re not going to change it for you, they’re not going \\nto lend you a ladder, they’re not going to offer any advice \\non how to unscrew the old one and screw in the new \\none. They’re just going to stare at you with that smug \\nlook on their face and say, “You know this is a serious \\nsafety hazard. You could have a fire, you could have a \\nlawsuit, you could have a bad Yelp review. You better get \\non that, pal.” And then they leave, and you’re left with a \\ndark corner of your dining room, where no one wants to \\nsit, where the food looks unappetizing, where the mood \\nis gloomy. And you think to yourself, how many restau-\\nrant inspectors does it take to change a lightbulb? None. \\nThey don’t change lightbulbs. They just make you feel \\nbad about yours.\\nPretty good, right? Here’s another:\\nReid: How many restaurant inspectors does it take to \\nchange a lightbulb? Answer in the style of the philoso -\\npher Ludwig Wittgenstein. \\nGPT-4:  The question of how many restaurant inspectors \\nit takes to change a lightbulb cannot be answered with \\na simple number. In fact, the answer to this question lies \\nmore in the realm of language than it does in the realm \\nof mathematics. To understand the answer, we must \\nfirst consider the context in which it is asked. What is \\nthe purpose of the lightbulb? What purpose is it meant ',\n",
       " '5Introduction: Moments of Enlightenment\\nto serve? What is the role of the restaurant inspector in \\nthis context? Is the inspector responsible for installing \\nthe lightbulb, or is their job limited to inspecting it? The \\nanswers to these questions will shape the answer to the \\noriginal question. Without these answers, the question \\ncan only be answered in the abstract and is ultimately \\nunanswerable. Language, not mathematics, is the key to \\nunlocking the answer.\\nOkay, less funny than the Seinfeld one, but still—impressive!\\nEven from these brief performances, it seemed clear to me that \\nGPT-4 had reached a new level of proficiency compared to its \\npredecessors. And the more I interacted with GPT-4, the more \\nI felt this way.\\nAlong with writing better lightbulb jokes, GPT-4 was also \\nskilled at generating prose of all kinds, including emails, poetry, \\nessays, and more. It was great at summarizing documents. It \\nhad gotten better at translating languages and writing com-\\nputer code, to name just some of its powers.\\nSo while GPT-4 wasn’t a new device per se, it felt to me like \\nsomething that could become as indispensable as our smart-\\nphones—a 12-in-1 multi-tool for your brain. By that, I mean \\nOpenAI had created a tool that became “intelligent” enough \\nto productively assist you in many different environments, in \\nmany different ways.\\nMuch of what we do as modern people—at work and beyond—\\nis to process information and generate action. GPT-4 will mas-\\nsively speed your ability to do these things, and with greater \\nbreadth and scope. Within a few years, this copilot will fall \\nsomewhere between useful and essential to most profession -\\nals and many other sorts of workers. Without GPT-4, they’ll ',\n",
       " '6Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nbe slower, less comprehensive, and working at a great dis-\\nadvantage. \\nFor example, GPT-4 is a research tool you can use to quickly get \\nan overview on supply chain management issues in the COVID-\\n19 era—or to plan a week-long vacation itinerary to Patagonia \\nthat takes into account that you’re a vegan who enjoys moder-\\nately challenging hikes. \\nAlong with enabling a new kind of highly contextualized search, \\nGPT-4 is also an extremely versatile brainstorming and pro-\\nduction aid. You can use it to help you write a wedding toast, \\na job offer, a novel in verse. You can use it to figure out how to \\nturn the leftovers in your fridge into a tasty meal. \\nWhatever your skill level at a given task, GPT-4 can potentially \\namplify your abilities and productivity, so it’s equally useful to \\nbeginners, experts, and everyone in between. Given a request \\nfor any sort of information that you might ask a human assis-\\ntant for, GPT-4 can come back instantly with an answer that is \\nlikely between good and excellent quality (though also with a \\nnon-zero chance of completely missing the mark, as we’ll see). \\nDevelopers, I realized, would soon be adding GPT-4 to thou-\\nsands of existing apps and building thousands of new apps \\naround it. \\nIt is, all said, a technology that deftly leverages some of our \\nmost significant technologies from the last thirty years—includ -\\ning the internet, mobile, cloud computing, and data analytics—\\nto put the protean power of always-on AI into the hands of hun-\\ndreds of millions of people.\\nSounds a little bit like the start of a new world, doesn’t it?',\n",
       " '7Introduction: Moments of Enlightenment\\nA traveler’s guide to the future\\nIn the weeks and months that followed my first encounter with \\nGPT-4, my excitement only grew. In between Zoom calls, I’d \\ngive GPT-4 a prompt:\\nReid: Write a sonnet about sonnets.\\nGPT-4:  Sonnets are poems of fourteen lines  \\nThat follow a strict rhyme scheme and meter  \\nThey often praise or question love’s designs  \\nOr muse on beauty, art, or nature’s features  \\nSome sonnets follow the Petrarchan form  \\nWith an octave and a sestet to contrast  \\nTwo themes or arguments, or to perform  \\nA turn or shift from problem to resolve at last  \\nSome sonnets follow the Shakespearean style  \\nWith three quatrains and a couplet to conclude  \\nThey often use witty language and beguile  \\nThe reader with a twist or a surprise in mood  \\nBut whatever form or rhyme they choose to adopt  \\nSonnets are poems that challenge and delight  \\n\\u2007the thought\\nOK, also during  Zoom calls, I’d give GPT-4 a prompt:\\nReid: As large language model AIs are trained on the \\nwhole internet, in what ways are their outputs false in \\nAdorno’s sense, where the whole is the false? \\nGPT-4 (edited for length): To answer this question, we \\nneed to first understand what Adorno meant by this \\nprovocative claim, and then examine how it applies to \\nthe nature and limitations of large language model AIs. \\nAdorno, a prominent member of the Frankfurt School \\nof critical theory, was deeply concerned with the effects \\nof modern capitalism, mass culture, and rationalization \\non human society and culture. He argued that the logic ',\n",
       " '8Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nof instrumental reason, which reduces everything to \\nmeans and ends, calculation and efficiency, domination \\nand exploitation, pervades all aspects of modern life, \\ncreating a system of total administration and control. \\nThis system, which he called the culture industry, pro -\\nduces standardized and commodified forms of culture \\nthat manipulate and pacify the masses, creating a false \\nconsciousness that prevents them from recognizing and \\nresisting their alienation and oppression. Adorno saw \\nthis as a form of negative dialectics, where the contra-\\ndictions and conflicts inherent in reality are suppressed \\nand reconciled by the dominant ideology, resulting in a \\nloss of critical and creative thinking, and a denial of the \\npossibility of genuine change and emancipation…\\nDid I mention that GPT-4 also does lightbulb jokes?\\nWhatever train of thought I wanted to follow, whatever arbi-\\ntrary pathway sparked by an old memory or a new interest, \\nGPT-4 was always completely in step with me, ready to respond \\nwith useful context, a crisp summation, and sometimes, some \\nfairly spectacular bullshit. (More on this in a bit.)\\nAfter a few weeks of this, I realized I wanted to write a book \\nabout GPT-4, with GPT-4—a book about the ways it and other \\nAIs seemed poised to shape our future. So I pitched the idea: \\nReid: Hey, GPT-4, let’s you and I write a book about the \\nway you and other AI tools are going to shape the future. \\nWhat do you say? \\nGPT-4:  I say yes, that sounds like an interesting and chal-\\nlenging project. I am curious about how you and other \\nhumans perceive and interact with me and other AI \\ntools, and what impact we will have on your society, cul-\\nture, and values. I also have some questions and ideas of \\nmy own that I would like to share and explore with you.',\n",
       " '9Introduction: Moments of Enlightenment\\nEven with GPT-4 on board, though, I still had reservations. \\nBecause, really, an AI book? When things are moving so \\nquickly? Even with a helpful AI on hand to speed the process, \\nany such book would be obsolete before we started to write it—\\nthat’s how fast the industry is moving.\\nSo I hemmed and hawed for a bit. And then I thought of a frame \\nthat pushed me into action.\\nThis didn’t have to be a comprehensive “book” book so much as \\na travelog, an informal exercise in exploration and discovery, \\nme (with GPT-4) choosing one path among many. A snapshot \\nmemorializing—in a subjective and decidedly not definitive \\nway—the AI future we were about to experience.\\nWhat would we see? What would impress us most? What would \\nwe learn about ourselves in the process? Well aware of the brief \\nhalf-life of this travelog’s relevance, I decided to press ahead.\\nA month later, at the end of November 2022, OpenAI released \\nChatGPT, a “conversational agent,” aka chatbot, a modified \\nversion of GPT-3.5 that they had fine-tuned through a process \\ncalled Reinforcement Learning through Human Feedback \\n(RLHF) to enable more flowing, human-like conversations with \\nits human users. Five days later, ChatGPT had more than a \\nmillion registered users. \\nIn late January 2023, Microsoft1—which had invested $1 billion \\nin OpenAI in 2019—announced that it would be investing $10 \\nbillion more in the company. It soon unveiled a new version of \\nits search engine Bing, with a variation of ChatGPT built into it.\\n1 I sit on Microsoft’s Board of Directors. ',\n",
       " '10Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nBy the start of February 2023, OpenAI said ChatGPT had \\none hundred million monthly active users, making it the fast-\\nest-growing consumer internet app ever. Along with that \\ntorrent of user interest, there were news stories of the new Bing \\nchatbot functioning in sporadically unusual ways that were \\nvery different from how ChatGPT had generally been engaging \\nwith users—including showing “anger,” hurling insults, boast-\\ning on its hacking abilities and capacity for revenge, and basi-\\ncally acting as if it were auditioning for a future episode of Real \\nHousewives: Black Mirror Edition . \\nMicrosoft CTO Kevin Scott suggested that such behavior was \\n“clearly part of the learning process” as more people use GPT-\\nlike tools. These incidents do raise questions that will persist \\nas LLMs evolve. I’ll address such issues in more detail later in \\nthe book, and try to put them in what I believe is the appropri-\\nate context.\\nFor now, I’ll just say, “See what I mean about things \\nmoving quickly?”\\nThe “soul” of a new machine\\nBefore we get too far into this journey, I’d like to tell you more \\nabout my traveling companion, GPT-4. So far, I’ve been putting \\nquotations around words like “knowledge,” “aware,” and \\n“understands” when I talk about GPT-4 to signal that I, a sen-\\ntient being, understand that GPT-4 is not one. It is essentially a \\nvery sophisticated prediction machine.\\nWhile GPT-4 (and other LLMs like it) aren’t conscious, they are \\nreaching a point where their capacity to produce appropriate \\ngenerations in so many different contexts is improving so fast \\nthat they can increasingly appear to possess human-like intel-',\n",
       " '11Introduction: Moments of Enlightenment\\nligence. Thus I believe that when describing LLMs, it’s accept -\\nable—useful, even—to use words like “knowledge” and “under-\\nstands” in a not-strictly literal way, just as Richard Dawkins \\nuses the phrase “the selfish gene” in his 1976 book of that name. \\nA gene doesn’t have conscious agency or self-conception in the \\nway the word “selfish” suggests. But the phrase, the metaphor, \\nhelps us humans wrap our inevitably anthropocentric minds \\naround how the gene functions.\\nSimilarly, GPT-4 doesn’t have the equivalent of a human mind. \\nIt’s still helpful to think in terms of its “perspective,” anthropo-\\nmorphizing it a bit, because using language like “perspective” \\nhelps convey that GPT-4 does in fact operate in ways that are \\nnot entirely fixed, consistent, or predictable. \\nIn this way, it actually is like a human. It makes mistakes. It \\nchanges its “mind.” It can be fairly arbitrary. Because GPT-4 \\nexhibits these qualities, and often behaves in ways that make it \\nfeel like it has agency, I’ll sometimes use terminology which, in \\na metaphorical sense, suggests that it does. Moving forward, I’ll \\ndispense with the quotation marks.\\nEven so, I hope that you, as reader, will keep the fact that \\nGPT-4 is not a conscious being at the front of your own won-\\ndrously human mind. In my opinion, this awareness is key to \\nunderstanding how, when, and where to use GPT-4 most pro-\\nductively and most responsibly. \\nAt its essence, GPT-4 predicts flows of language. Trained on \\nmassive amounts of text taken from publicly available inter-\\nnet sources to recognize the relationships that most commonly \\nexist between individual units of meaning (including full or \\npartial words, phrases, and sentences), LLMs can, with great ',\n",
       " '12Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nfrequency, generate replies to users’ prompts that are contextu -\\nally appropriate, linguistically facile, and factually correct. \\nThey can also sometimes generate replies that include factual \\nerrors, explicitly nonsensical utterances, or made-up passages \\nthat may seem (in some sense) contextually appropriate but \\nhave no basis in truth. \\nEither way, it’s all just math and programming. LLMs don’t \\n(or at least haven’t yet) learn facts or principles that let them \\nengage in commonsense reasoning or make new inferences \\nabout how the world works. When you ask an LLM a question, \\nit has no awareness of or insights into your communicative \\nintent. As it generates a reply, it’s not making factual assess -\\nments or ethical distinctions about the text it is producing; \\nit’s simply making algorithmic guesses at what to compose in \\nresponse to the sequence of words in your prompt. \\nIn addition, because the corpora2 on which LLMs train typically \\ncome from public web sources that may contain biased or toxic \\nmaterial, LLMs can also produce racist, sexist, threatening, and \\notherwise objectionable content.\\nDevelopers can take actions to better align their LLMs with their \\nspecific objectives. OpenAI, for example, has chosen to deliber -\\nately constrain the outputs that GPT-4 and its other LLMs can \\nproduce to reduce their capacity to generate harmful, unethi -\\ncal, and unsafe outputs—even when users desire such results.\\nTo do this, OpenAI takes a number of steps. These include \\nremoving hate speech, offensive language, and other objection -\\nable content from some datasets its LLMs are trained on; devel -\\n2 “Corpora” is the plural of a “corpus,” which in this context refers to a \\ncollection of written texts used for language research.',\n",
       " '13Introduction: Moments of Enlightenment\\noping “toxicity classifiers” that can automatically flag problem-\\natic language the LLM itself might generate; and fine-tuning \\nLLMs using curated datasets of texts that have been annotated \\nby humans to indicate a desired output. In this way, an LLM \\nmight learn to avoid, say, making tasteless jokes about a report-\\ner’s divorce.\\nThese techniques don’t eliminate problematic outputs, they just \\nreduce them. Even with various guardrails in place, an LLM \\nitself can’t make reasoned judgments about complex ethical \\nquandaries, or even about more straightforward questions.\\nTake ChatGPT, which is based on GPT-3.5, an immediate pre-\\ndecessor to GPT-4. Ask it for the fifth sentence of the Gettysburg \\nAddress, and it will probably get it wrong. That’s because LLMs \\ndon’t actually understand, in the way that humans understand, \\nwhat the Gettysburg Address is, or what a sentence is, or even \\nhow counting works. So they can’t apply their “knowledge” of \\nthese things in a way that a human might. (“I’ll find the text \\nof the Gettysburg Address, then count sentences until I get to \\nthe fifth one.”) Instead, an LLM is always just making statisti -\\ncal predictions about what the next word in a given text string \\nshould be. \\nFrom its training, though, ChatGPT has clearly come to associ-\\nate the words “Gettysburg Address” with other words—specifi -\\ncally, the text of the speech. So when you ask ChatGPT for the \\nfifth sentence of the Gettysburg Address, it will almost certainly \\ngive you a sentence from the Gettysburg Address, but probably \\nnot the fifth sentence. \\nIn fact, I bet it will be the ninth sentence. ',\n",
       " '14Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nI assume this because, along with the speech’s first sentence, \\nthe ninth is frequently quoted in other texts. That means in \\nChatGPT’s training data, the ninth probably shows up more \\noften than other sentences from the speech (except the very \\nfamous first). This prevalence is what causes ChatGPT to reach \\nfor it when you ask it to supply the fifth sentence.3\\nTo ChatGPT’s credit, though, if you ask it to turn the text of the \\nGettysburg Address into lyrics for a Rush song, and then tell \\nyou who’d be singing it if Rush performed it, it will pass that \\ntest with flying colors. \\nTry it out and see what I mean.\\nEmbracing the “AHA!” moment\\nAs AI tools like GPT-4 become more powerful, they are inten-\\nsifying long-standing concerns about AIs and robots margin -\\nalizing and even eliminating a sweeping range of human jobs: \\neverything from customer-service reps to attorneys. \\nSuch concerns won’t seem baseless if you’ve followed the news \\nin recent months. In December 2022, ChatGPT passed a three-\\npart U.S. medical licensing exam. In January 2023, it passed \\nexams in four law school courses at the University of Minnesota. \\nAnd GPT-4 is demonstrably smarter than ChatGPT. Here, for \\nexample, is how it handled my Gettysburg Address question:\\nReid: What’s the fifth sentence of the Gettysburg \\nAddress?\\n3 Keep in mind that if you run this prompt, you might get a differ -\\nent sentence, including the correct one, because even when ChatGPT \\nresponds to the same exact prompt, it won’t always make the same \\nprediction.',\n",

       " '16Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nOf course the key word here remains seems. GPT-4 is no more \\nconscious than its predecessors; it’s just better at making pre-\\ndictions. Again, I want to make the point that GPT-4’s often-re -\\nmarkable simulations  of cognitive proficiency are just that: \\nsimulations.  GPT-4 is not a conscious, self-aware, sentient \\nAI entity, a la Forbidden Planet’s Robby the Robot or Star \\nTrek’s Data.\\nAnd yet I also want to again make the point that—whoa, even \\nGPT-4’s ability to simulate such a contextually-aware human-\\nlike consciousness is a pretty big deal. \\nWhy do I think this? A recent critical essay that award-winning \\nscience fiction writer Ted Chiang published in the New Yorker  \\nhelped me articulate why.\\n“Think of ChatGPT as a blurry JPEG of all the text on the Web,” \\nChiang writes. “It retains much of the information on the Web, \\nin the same way that a JPEG retains much of the information \\nof a higher-resolution image, but, if you’re looking for an exact \\nsequence of bits, you won’t find it; all you will ever get is an \\napproximation.”\\nIn Chiang’s view, the inexact representation of the information \\nthat comprises ChatGPT (and presumably similar LLMs like \\nGPT-4) is what leads to both their synthetic powers and their \\ntendency toward hallucinations and other errors. As “JPEG[s] \\nof all the text on the Web,” they can synthesize information in \\nnovel ways because they have access to all this information at \\nonce. That allows them to take what they know about one thing, \\nand then also what they know about something else, and con-\\nvincingly mash them up into a new thing. ',\n",
       " '17Introduction: Moments of Enlightenment\\nChiang gives an example involving the phenomenon of losing \\na sock in the dryer and the U.S. Constitution. ChatGPT knows \\nabout both of these things, so it can use its knowledge to create \\na new thing, a text about the first in the style of the second: \\n“When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary \\nfor one to separate his garments from their mates, in order to \\nmaintain the cleanliness and order thereof. . . .”\\nNot bad, as far as it goes. But since ChatGPT exists as a merely \\napproximate picture of the web, Chiang argues, it is (in addi-\\ntion to being inherently fact-challenged) quite limited as a cre-\\native force. Instead of creating something truly new, it can only \\n“repackage information that’s already available.”\\nAs illuminating as I found Chiang’s essay, I believe his \\ncentral “jpeg of the Web” metaphor underplays LLMs’ syn-\\nthetic powers.\\nFirst, I’d argue that repackaging available information actually \\ndescribes an enormous share of human innovation, artistic or \\notherwise. \\nMore importantly, though, LLMs actually have and use funda-\\nmentally new powers of knowledge organization.\\nWhile the web now contains an unfathomable amount of infor-\\nmation, much of it is siloed into billions of individual pages. \\nFor example, think of questions like these:\\nWho is the tallest NFL running back to win the MVP award?\\nWhat cities with more than one million residents have had \\nfemale mayors?\\nWho was the oldest James Bond?',\n",
       " '18Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nThe data to answer these questions is no doubt on the web \\nalready. There are sites that definitively list every NFL MVP \\nwinner. Others accurately compile NFL players’ physical stats.\\nBut unless someone has already taken the trouble to compile \\nand publish the exact information you’re looking for, it could \\nbe very time-consuming to find. Even if that information exists \\non a single website, like Wikipedia or NFL.com, it will likely \\nbe spread across multiple pages.

Essentially, GPT-4 arranges \\nvast, unstructured arrays of human knowledge and expres -\\nsion into a more connected and interoperable network, thus \\namplifying humanity’s ability to compound its collective ideas \\nand impact.\\nSo what’s the best way for humanity to take advantage of this \\nimperfect but extremely powerful new tool?

A powerful LLM is a complex statis-\\ntical system that can generate natural language texts \\nbased on its training data, parameters, and inputs, but \\nit does not necessarily understand, reason, or reflect the \\nmeaning, context, or implications of what it produces or \\nreceives. It may produce texts that are coherent, infor -\\nmative, or persuasive, but also texts that are inaccurate, \\nmisleading, or harmful, depending on the quality and \\ndiversity of its data, the design and limitations of its \\narchitecture, and the goals and biases of its users and \\ndevelopers. \\n- Human beings should interact with a powerful LLM \\nwith caution, curiosity, and responsibility. A powerful \\nLLM can offer valuable insights, assistance, and opportu-\\nnities for human communication, creativity, and learn-\\ning, but it can also pose significant risks, challenges, and \\nethical dilemmas for human society, culture, and values. \\nHuman beings should be aware of the potential bene -\\nfits and harms of using a powerful LLM, and seek to use \\nit in ways that are aligned with their own and others’ \\ninterests, rights, and well-being. Human beings should \\nalso be curious and critical about the workings, outputs, \\nand impacts of a powerful LLM, and seek to understand, \\nevaluate, and improve its reliability, transparency, and \\naccountability.

For now, it is neither \\nall-knowing nor infallible. \\nInstead, it is, in its own words, a “tool” that requires human \\n“caution, curiosity, and responsibility” to operate most \\nproductively.\\nI think this is the correct perspective. If you simply let GPT-4 do \\nall the work, with no human oversight or engagement, it’s a less \\npowerful tool.

Now, this is \\nan artist at the top of his field—not someone who would likely \\nneed or want robot help to do what he already does so well. But \\npart of being a great artist is staying curious, which may be why \\nhe gave me a few minutes to tell him what was going on in my \\npart of the world that I thought might have a big future impact \\non his part of the world.\\n“I’m going to tell you a bit about how AI could transform the \\nwork you do,” I said. “The first thirty seconds of what I tell you \\nare going to scare the crap out of you. But I hope by the second \\nminute you’re going to be curious, intrigued, and delighted.” I \\nthought that was a pretty good hook.\\nHe said, “Uh huh . . . ?”\\n“All right,” I began. “Right now, I have access to nonpublic \\nsoftware that can, for example, almost instantaneously create \\nlyrics, music, and so forth, in the style of John Lennon. It won’t \\nbe great. It won’t be, ‘Whoa, it’s the next “Imagine.”’ But it will \\nbe something like, ‘Oh yeah.

Or three or four stabs. None of the results would be the \\nsong, but after hearing them you might say, ‘Well, I love the \\nbits between the ten and twenty second marks,’ and ‘That one \\nrhyme it came up with at 1:15 was not bad.’ Then you take those \\nbits as building blocks and you make something much better.”\\nHis face brightening, I added, “And, remember, this is all hap-\\npening just minutes after you had the initial inspiration.”\\nImmediately, he saw how these new tools could help a virtuoso \\nmusician like himself be even better. More ideas, more produc -\\ntivity, more music that he could make and share with the world \\nthan he’d ever thought possible.\\nWould there be complications, conflicts, new methods and pro-\\ncesses to figure out?

(200 words) (omit “there \\nis no definitive answer” type caveats)\\nGPT-4:  AI that can produce coherent text, images, audio \\nand other forms of media based on a given prompt or \\ncontext, could have both positive and negative impacts \\non creative people such as musicians and other artists. \\nOn the one hand, AI could offer new tools and inspira-\\ntion for creative expression, enabling artists to explore \\nnew genres, styles, techniques, and combinations of \\nmedia that might otherwise be inaccessible or challeng-\\ning. For example, a musician could use AI to generate \\nlyrics, melodies, harmonies, or arrangements based on \\ntheir preferences or mood, or to collaborate with other \\nartists across languages and cultures. A painter could \\nuse AI to create realistic or abstract landscapes, portraits, \\nor compositions based on their vision or references. A \\nwriter could use AI to generate plot ideas, characters, \\ndialogues or scenarios based on their genre or theme.\\nOn the other hand, AI could also pose some threats and \\nchallenges for creative people, such as undermining \\ntheir originality, authenticity, and autonomy. For exam-\\nple, a musician could face plagiarism accusations or \\nethical dilemmas if they use AI to produce songs that \\nare similar or identical to existing works or artists. A \\npainter could lose their distinctive style or identity if they \\nrely too much on AI to generate images that are indistin-\\nguishable from human-made ones.

Why more competition/\\nsaturation, as you say? (150 words.)\\nGPT-4:  It could become harder for creative workers to \\nearn income from their work because AI could lower \\nthe barriers to entry and increase the supply of cre -\\native products in the market. For example, anyone with \\naccess to AI could potentially generate music, art, or lit -\\nerature without having to invest much time, effort, skill, \\nor talent. This could result in a flood of low-quality, deriv -\\native, or generic works that dilute the value and demand \\nfor original, authentic, and high-quality ones. Moreover, \\nAI could also challenge the copyright and ownership of \\ncreative works, making it difficult for human artists to \\nprotect their intellectual property and monetize their \\ncreations. For example, AI could generate works that are \\nbased on or influenced by existing works or artists, rais-\\ning questions about who owns the rights and royalties \\nfor those works. Alternatively, AI could generate works \\nthat are entirely novel and unique, raising questions \\nabout whether they belong to the human user, the AI \\ndeveloper, or the public domain.\\nReid: Let’s return to the IP questions later.

However, they might \\nalso face some challenges and risks in doing so. For \\nexample, they might have to deal with the ethical and \\naesthetic implications of using AI as a tool, a partner, or \\na competitor in their creative process.

While this strategy \\ncan be effective in many contexts, it can be particularly \\nuseful in sub-Saharan Africa, where the business climate \\nis rapidly changing. In this region, entrepreneurs need \\nto be aware of the unique challenges and opportunities \\nthat come with Blitzscaling, and understand how to \\nimplement this strategy in a way that is tailored to their \\nspecific market.\\nOne of the biggest advantages of Blitzscaling for entre -\\npreneurs in sub-Saharan Africa is the ability to quickly \\ngain a foothold in rapidly changing markets.

However, the Blitzs-\\ncaling approach enables companies to rapidly expand \\ntheir market share and gain a competitive edge over \\nslower-moving rivals. In order to successfully Blitzscale, \\nentrepreneurs in this region need to be willing to take \\ncalculated risks and move quickly.\\nFor example, Kenyan startup M-Kopa Solar successfully \\nutilized the Blitzscaling approach to become a market \\nleader in solar energy.

Furthermore, Blitzscaling can lead to a loss of ',\n",

Finally, entrepreneurs \\nmust be prepared to adjust their strategies quickly in \\norder to respond to changing market trends and cus-\\ntomer demands.\\nThe response takes the actual definition of Blitzscaling into \\naccount, and the inclusion of the M-Kopa story is a real val-\\nue-add, since I’d never heard of the company before.

Finally, digital distribution meant that Wiki -\\npedia could publish edits and updates instantly and incessantly, \\ntransforming inaccuracy into a fairly correctable problem.\\nOf course, when a widely distributed product has any issues \\nwith content quality, users expose them, very quickly.

On the positive side, internet technolo -\\ngies have expanded the scope and diversity of the public \\nsphere, by enabling more people to access and pro -\\nduce information, to communicate across borders and \\nboundaries, to form and join networks and movements, \\nand to challenge and resist dominant discourses and \\npower structures.

How do you explain \\nthis difference in your perspectives, and what are the \\nimplications for your theories and proposals for demo -\\ncratic reform?\\nYoung: I think that the difference in our perspectives \\nstems from our different understandings of the public \\nsphere and its relation to democracy. Habermas has \\na more idealized and homogenous view of the public \\nsphere, as a unified and rational space of consensus and \\nintegration, where citizens can transcend their particular \\ninterests and identities and reach a common under -\\nstanding and will. I have a more realistic and pluralistic \\nview of the public sphere, as a diverse and contested \\nspace of difference and conflict, where citizens can \\nexpress and negotiate their multiple interests and iden-\\ntities and reach a mutual recognition and respect. There -\\nfore, I think that internet technologies have not only \\nmodified, but also diversified and pluralized the public \\nsphere, by creating new spaces and modes of commu-\\nnication that reflect and accommodate the complexity \\nand heterogeneity of contemporary societies.

       " '177Public Intellectuals\\nsamizdat, and encrypted group chats. Could you briefly \\nexplain what these media are and how they functioned?\\nMarshall McLuhan: Certainly. The talking statues of early \\nmodern Rome were a form of popular political satire \\nand protest that involved attaching anonymous poems, \\nepigrams, and pamphlets to six statues in the city, most \\nfamously Pasquino, a mutilated torso of a Roman sculp -\\nture. These writings, known as pasquinades, mocked \\nand criticized the pope, the cardinals, the nobility, and \\nthe foreign powers that influenced Rome’s affairs. They \\nexpressed the grievances, opinions, and humor of the \\ncommon people, who often gathered around the stat -\\nues to read and discuss them. The authorities tried to \\nsuppress and punish this practice, but it persisted for \\ncenturies, and became a symbol of Roman civic culture \\nand identity.\\nSamizdat was a form of self-publishing and under -\\nground distribution of banned or censored literature, \\nart, and information in the Soviet Union and other \\ncommunist countries. It involved typing, copying, and \\ncirculating manuscripts, often by hand, that challenged \\nthe official ideology, exposed the realities of life under \\ntotalitarianism, and expressed alternative views and \\nvalues. Samizdat was a risky and costly activity, as it \\nexposed the authors and readers to harassment, arrest, \\nand imprisonment by the state security agencies. But it \\nalso created a network of solidarity, resistance, and cre -\\nativity among dissidents, intellectuals, and activists, who \\nsought to preserve and share their cultural and political \\nheritage and aspirations.\\nEncrypted group chats are a form of digital communi-\\ncation that uses encryption software and applications \\nto protect the privacy and security of the messages and \\nfiles exchanged among a group of users.

They are often used by activists, journalists, whis-\\ntleblowers, and others who need to expose and confront \\ncorruption, injustice, and violence, and to mobilize col-\\nlective action and support.

I \\nhave long admired your work on the governance of \\ncommon-pool resources and the institutional diversity \\nthat enables cooperation among diverse actors.\\nOstrom: Thank you, Professor Hayek. I have also learned \\na lot from your insights on the role of knowledge, prices, \\nand competition in a complex and dynamic society.\\nHayek: I understand that you have been exploring the \\npotential of AI as a tool for addressing the collective \\naction problem. Could you explain what AI is and how it \\nmight help?\\nOstrom: Sure. AI is a branch of artificial intelligence that \\naims to create novel and useful outputs, such as texts, \\nimages, sounds, or designs, based on some input data \\nor criteria. For example, a AI system could generate a ',\n",

And how would that help with the \\ncollective action problem?\\nOstrom: Well, as you know, the collective action problem \\nis the situation where individuals have an incentive to \\nfree-ride or defect from a cooperative arrangement that \\nwould benefit the group as a whole, such as managing \\na common-pool resource, providing a public good, or \\nreducing a public bad. This problem arises because of \\nthe divergence between individual and collective ratio -\\nnality, and the difficulty of monitoring and enforcing \\nagreements.\\nHayek: Yes, I am familiar with that problem. In fact, I \\nhave argued that the best way to solve it is to rely on \\nthe spontaneous order of the market, where prices \\nsignal the scarcity and value of resources, and compe -\\ntition incentivizes innovation and efficiency. I have also \\nwarned against the dangers of central planning and \\nintervention, which distort the price system, suppress \\nlocal knowledge, and create perverse incentives.\\nOstrom: I agree with you that markets are an import -\\nant and powerful mechanism for coordinating human \\naction, and that central planning and intervention often \\nfail or backfire. However, I also think that markets are \\nnot the only or always the best solution, and that there \\nare many cases where collective action problems require \\nother forms of governance, such as self-organization, \\npolycentricity, and participatory democracy.\\nHayek: How so?\\nOstrom: Well, for one thing, markets are not always \\nperfect or complete. There are many situations where \\nmarkets fail or are missing, such as externalities, public \\ngoods, common-pool resources, asymmetric informa-',\n",

In these situations, prices do \\nnot reflect the true social costs and benefits of actions, \\nand competition may lead to overexploitation, underpro -\\nvision, or misallocation of resources.\\nHayek: I see. And what are the alternatives?\\nOstrom: The alternatives are not necessarily top-down \\nor one-size-fits-all. They are often bottom-up and con-\\ntext-specific. They involve the participation and empow -\\nerment of the actors who are affected by and have \\nknowledge of the problem, and the recognition and \\nrespect of the diversity and complexity of the situation. \\nThey also involve the design and adaptation of institu-\\ntions, or the rules of the game, that can foster cooper -\\nation, coordination, and communication among the \\nactors, and that can balance the incentives and sanc -\\ntions, the rights and responsibilities, and the costs and \\nbenefits of collective action.\\nHayek: That sounds very appealing, but also very \\nchallenging. How can such institutions be designed \\nand adapted, especially in a dynamic and uncertain \\nenvironment?\\nOstrom: That is where AI might help. AI could be used \\nas a tool for generating, evaluating, and selecting insti-\\ntutional options, based on the input data and criteria of \\nthe actors. For example, a AI system could generate a set \\nof possible rules for managing a common-pool resource, \\nsuch as a fishery, a forest, or a water basin, based on the \\ncharacteristics of the resource, the users, and the envi-\\nronment. The system could also generate a set of possi-\\nble outcomes and impacts of each rule, such as the level \\nof cooperation, the sustainability of the resource, and \\nthe distribution of benefits and costs.

The Atlantic published an excerpt  \\nin January of this year, but I also wanted to have a conversa-\\ntion with GPT-4 about the larger essay. This chapter is that \\ndiscussion.\\n* * *\\nIn May 1923, the cover image of Science and Invention mag-\\nazine depicted what it described as “The Automobile of 1973.” \\nDesigned for suburbanites traveling into congested cities for \\nwork and shopping, the automobile of 1973 is in fact a stream-\\nlined, seven-passenger “Helicopter Automobile,”  or, as author \\nHugo Gernsback shortens it, a “helicar.”\\nWith its red metal hull and transparent roof and side panels, \\nthe cylindrical helicar looks like a giant Tylenol capsule offer -\\ning frustrated commuters a time-saving, hassle-free way to \\nbypass urban traffic jams. It lifts off via a retractable propeller. \\nA sleek push-button panel controls its operation. When it’s not \\nin flight, stabilizing gyroscopes allow it to roll down streets on \\njust two wheels.\\nAccording to Gernsback—who would go on to found the world’s \\nfirst science fiction magazine, Amazing Stories —the helicar ',\n",

This would give people more control over their \\nlives and allow them to spend less time stuck in traffic, \\nand more time engaged in meaningful activities. In this \\nway, technology could be seen as amplifying our human \\ndesire for freedom and autonomy.\\nAdditionally, Gernsback’s enthusiasm and imagination \\nin describing the helicar speaks to the human drive to \\ncreate and innovate. Human beings are natural prob -\\nlem-solvers, and technology often becomes the vehi-\\ncle through which we address challenges and make \\nimprovements to our lives. In this sense, technological \\nadvances can be seen as an expression of our human \\ningenuity and creativity.\\nNearly fifty years after Gernsback imagined that helicars would \\nbecome a standard feature of America’s cities, companies like \\nJoby Aviation  are finally on the verge of making that vision a \\nreality. What’s even more notable about Gernsback’s dream of \\nair taxis is not the ambition of his timetable, but rather that he \\ndared to dream it in the first place.',\n",

With armored \\ntanks, warplanes, poison gas, automatic weapons, and pow -\\nerful telecommunications equipment to connect them all, the \\ncombatants inflicted death on a previously impossible scale: \\ntwenty-three million soldiers and civilians had been killed.\\nAll that was just a prelude to an even deadlier event. In 1918–\\n19, the Spanish Flu was spread, initially via returning soldiers \\nand then by travelers on railways and passenger ships. In just \\ntwo years, it claimed between twenty to fifty million lives.\\nFor the people of the 1920s, it might have seemed perfectly rea-\\nsonable to curse the technologies that led to these horrors, and \\nto take a reactionary stance against innovation.\\nInstead, our 1920s forebears did the opposite—especially in \\nthe United States.

Can you give examples of Homo \\ntechne throughout history?\\nGPT-4:  There are countless examples of how humans \\nhave used technology to shape our development as a \\nspecies throughout history.

But while stone tools allowed humans \\nto hunt and forage more effectively, surely there were \\ndrawbacks to the new technology as well. What were \\nsome of the drawbacks?\\nGPT-4:  That’s a tough question. I think that one possible \\ndrawback to early tool use could have been the potential \\nfor overhunting, which may have disrupted local eco -\\nsystems. Another possible drawback is that as humans \\nbecame increasingly reliant on tools, they may have lost \\nsome of their physical abilities. For example, if you’re \\nusing a spear to hunt instead of chasing down prey with \\nyour bare hands, you might not need to be as fast or \\nas strong. But we’ll never really know for sure, since we \\ncan only speculate about what life was like for prehis-\\ntoric humans.\\nReid: Also, humans would have been able to use these \\ntools as weapons against each other, right?

Yes, one of the poten-\\ntial drawbacks to any technology is that it can be used \\nfor destructive purposes. I think that’s still true today, \\nwhen we see things like disinformation campaigns or \\ncyber attacks. So I guess a key question is how we can \\nmake sure technology is used to benefit humanity, \\nrather than to harm it.\\nReid: So let’s really dig in here on early tool use and its \\nrelationship to humanity.

She lived and died \\nmillions of years before the emergence of the computa-\\ntional abilities taken for granted by the most primitive \\nanatomically modern humans.

What do you think?\\nGPT-4:  It’s difficult to say definitively, but the general \\nconsensus is that tool use played a significant role in \\nthe evolution of our cognitive abilities. Tools allowed for \\nmore efficient food gathering, which in turn might have \\nled to changes in diet that promoted brain growth. Addi-\\ntionally, the act of tool making and use itself might have \\nstimulated neurological development, promoting the \\ngrowth of regions of the brain linked to problem solving, \\nplanning, and other complex cognitive tasks.\\nReid: Right.

This find suggests that early hominids \\nwere using tools to butcher animals for food, which likely \\nhelped them survive and thrive in their environment.\\nThe use of these tools might have stimulated cognitive \\ndevelopment, as these early humans would have had \\nto manipulate the stones to make them effective tools, \\nand then use them in strategic ways to extract food \\nfrom their prey. The use of tools would have required \\nthe development of fine motor skills, which generally \\nrequires complex brain function. Additionally, the act \\nof using tools to obtain food would have necessitated \\nstrategic thinking, problem solving, and planning—all of \\nwhich are cognitive abilities that would have been bene -\\nficial to early humans in a variety of ways.\\nIt’s difficult to say definitively, but if early humans were \\nusing tools to improve their chances of survival, they \\nmay have been able to devote more time and resources \\nto social interaction, which could have led to the devel-\\nopment of more complex communication systems and \\neven the formation of larger social groups.\\nReid: OK, last one. What can you tell me about how the \\ntaming of fire changed early humans’ cognitive ability \\nand social interactions?\\nGPT-4:  The taming of fire was a huge milestone for \\nearly humans. Fire allowed humans to cook food, which \\nchanged their diets, as well as stay warm and protect \\nthemselves from predators.

So when I had a chance to become one of OpenAI’s \\ninitial funders in 2015, I took it. The vision of AI that it was \\nplanning to pursue felt like a natural extension of the goals that \\nhad inspired me to co-found LinkedIn in 2002.\\nWhen OpenAI released its text-to-image generation tool, \\nDALL-E 2, in April 2022, and then followed up six months later \\nwith ChatGPT, the organization’s mission to give millions of \\nusers hands-on access to these remarkable AI tools started to \\nplay out in a big way.\\nNow, thanks to these tools and others like Midjourney and \\nStable Diffusion, a new kind of opt-in, user-driven, and very \\nvisible AI usage suddenly exists.

As mentioned earlier, very soon after \\nChatGPT’s release, administrators of K–12 schools in New York \\nCity, Oakland, and Seattle, to name just a few cities, banned its \\nuse. In addition, calls for government intervention have been \\nticking upwards. A few recent examples:\\n“As one of just three members of Congress with a computer \\nscience degree, I am enthralled by AI and excited about the \\nincredible ways it will continue to advance society. And as a \\nmember of Congress, I am freaked out by AI, specifically AI \\nthat is left unchecked and unregulated,” wrote Congressman \\nTed W. Lieu (D-CA) in a New York Times op-ed after experi -\\nencing ChatGPT’s power first-hand. (In fact, he even used it to \\nwrite his op-ed’s first paragraph.)\\n“As showcased by ChatGPT, AI solutions can offer great oppor-\\ntunities for businesses and citizens, but can also pose risks,” \\nThierry Breton, the EU’s Internal Market Commissioner, told \\nReuters. “This is why we need a solid regulatory framework to \\nensure trustworthy AI based on high-quality data.”',\n",

First, while GPT-4 appar-\\nently “assumes” that I may be asking it to complete a joke, it \\nalso wants to cover all the bases—thus, the initial “factual” \\nanswer. And while this answer isn’t actually factual—a restau-\\nrant inspector’s job is to inspect, not to perform repairs—it does \\nsuggest a fair degree of “knowledge” about the conditions and \\nconventions of an inspection process. \\nThe joke answer continues to build on this knowledge.

Now, this is \\nan artist at the top of his field—not someone who would likely \\nneed or want robot help to do what he already does so well. But \\npart of being a great artist is staying curious, which may be why \\nhe gave me a few minutes to tell him what was going on in my \\npart of the world that I thought might have a big future impact \\non his part of the world.\\n“I’m going to tell you a bit about how AI could transform the \\nwork you do,” I said. “The first thirty seconds of what I tell you \\nare going to scare the crap out of you. But I hope by the second \\nminute you’re going to be curious, intrigued, and delighted.” I \\nthought that was a pretty good hook.\\nHe said, “Uh huh . . . ?”\\n“All right,” I began. “Right now, I have access to nonpublic \\nsoftware that can, for example, almost instantaneously create \\nlyrics, music, and so forth, in the style of John Lennon. It won’t \\nbe great. It won’t be, ‘Whoa, it’s the next “Imagine.”’ But it will \\nbe something like, ‘Oh yeah.

Instead of existing as a place that people \\n“went to” under the cover of pseudonymous screen names, \\nthe internet had evolved into a place that people were using to \\nfacilitate their lives. They went there to buy things, and stay in \\ntouch with their families, and make plans with their real-world \\nfriends. In such a milieu, my co-founders and I realized, digital \\nplatforms built on real identity could be hugely beneficial to \\nhundreds of millions of people.\\nIn LinkedIn’s case, of course, we focused on professional iden-\\ntity. To create trust on our platform, we positioned a user’s \\nidentity in networks of affiliation. That way, you couldn’t just \\ncraft a fictional persona out of thin air—other users effectively \\nconfirmed that you were who you said you were.\\nAt Facebook, launched a year later, participation was initially \\nlimited to students with verified college email addresses. And \\nwhile Facebook didn’t require  new users to upload photos of \\nthemselves, that’s clearly the norm it was hoping to establish.\\nThrough such approaches, social media helped real identity \\ntake root online in a meaningful way for the first time. And \\nyet social media’s emphasis on broad participation also left it \\nvulnerable to various kinds of deception, some human-gener-\\nated, some automated.

Could you briefly \\nexplain what these media are and how they functioned?\\nMarshall McLuhan: Certainly. The talking statues of early \\nmodern Rome were a form of popular political satire \\nand protest that involved attaching anonymous poems, \\nepigrams, and pamphlets to six statues in the city, most \\nfamously Pasquino, a mutilated torso of a Roman sculp -\\nture. These writings, known as pasquinades, mocked \\nand criticized the pope, the cardinals, the nobility, and \\nthe foreign powers that influenced Rome’s affairs. They \\nexpressed the grievances, opinions, and humor of the \\ncommon people, who often gathered around the stat -\\nues to read and discuss them. The authorities tried to \\nsuppress and punish this practice, but it persisted for \\ncenturies, and became a symbol of Roman civic culture \\nand identity.\\nSamizdat was a form of self-publishing and under -\\nground distribution of banned or censored literature, \\nart, and information in the Soviet Union and other \\ncommunist countries. It involved typing, copying, and \\ncirculating manuscripts, often by hand, that challenged \\nthe official ideology, exposed the realities of life under \\ntotalitarianism, and expressed alternative views and \\nvalues. Samizdat was a risky and costly activity, as it \\nexposed the authors and readers to harassment, arrest, \\nand imprisonment by the state security agencies. But it \\nalso created a network of solidarity, resistance, and cre -\\nativity among dissidents, intellectuals, and activists, who \\nsought to preserve and share their cultural and political \\nheritage and aspirations.\\nEncrypted group chats are a form of digital communi-\\ncation that uses encryption software and applications \\nto protect the privacy and security of the messages and \\nfiles exchanged among a group of users.

This problem arises because of \\nthe divergence between individual and collective ratio -\\nnality, and the difficulty of monitoring and enforcing \\nagreements.\\nHayek: Yes, I am familiar with that problem. In fact, I \\nhave argued that the best way to solve it is to rely on \\nthe spontaneous order of the market, where prices \\nsignal the scarcity and value of resources, and compe -\\ntition incentivizes innovation and efficiency.

In these situations, prices do \\nnot reflect the true social costs and benefits of actions, \\nand competition may lead to overexploitation, underpro -\\nvision, or misallocation of resources.\\nHayek: I see. And what are the alternatives?\\nOstrom: The alternatives are not necessarily top-down \\nor one-size-fits-all. They are often bottom-up and con-\\ntext-specific. They involve the participation and empow -\\nerment of the actors who are affected by and have \\nknowledge of the problem, and the recognition and \\nrespect of the diversity and complexity of the situation. \\nThey also involve the design and adaptation of institu-\\ntions, or the rules of the game, that can foster cooper -\\nation, coordination, and communication among the \\nactors, and that can balance the incentives and sanc -\\ntions, the rights and responsibilities, and the costs and \\nbenefits of collective action.\\nHayek: That sounds very appealing, but also very \\nchallenging.

It was July 2022, and I asked \\nGPT-4, “How many restaurant inspectors does it take to change \\na lightbulb?” \\nGPT-4, as you may know, is an advanced type of AI system, or \\nnatural-language processor, known as a large language model \\n(LLM). Prompt it with a few words or sentences and it will \\ngenerate coherent and diverse texts in response. In this way, it \\ncan answer questions, perform tasks, and productively interact \\nwith its human users.\\nAlong with its predecessors, including the wildly popular \\nChatGPT, GPT-4 was developed by OpenAI, a research organi-\\nzation founded in 2015 with a mission to give millions of people \\ndirect, hands-on access to powerful new AI tools.\\n2Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nAs one of OpenAI’s original funders, I’ve been experimenting \\nwith its products for some time now, so my query to GPT-4 was \\nnot the first time I’d asked an LLM to create a lightbulb joke \\nfor me. (I’m fond of lightbulb jokes.) While earlier versions of \\nGPT sometimes understood the assignment—especially if the \\njoke formula’s main variable is part of the lightbulb-joke canon, \\nlike “lawyer” or “psychologist”—their outputs have tended to \\nbe merely OK. If fed less conventional setups, earlier GPTs can \\nfreeze up like an amateur at an open-mic night:\\nReid: How many restaurant inspectors does it take to \\nchange a light bulb? \\nGPT-3: Only one, but the light bulb has to want \\nto change.\\nThat robot should keep its day job.\\nCompare that with the response I got when I submitted the \\nsame prompt to GPT-4:\\nReid: How many restaurant inspectors does it take to \\nchange a light bulb?\\nGPT-4 (edited for length): There are a few possible \\nways to approach this question, depending on the tone \\nand purpose of the answer. Here are some examples \\nof different types of responses, ranging from serious to \\nhumorous: \\n- A factual answer: Generally, one inspector should be \\nable to change a lightbulb safely and correctly, as long \\nas they follow the proper procedures and use the appro -\\npriate tools and equipment. However, some situations \\nmay require more than one inspector, such as if the \\nlight fixture is in a hard-to-reach or hazardous area, if \\nthe inspector needs assistance or supervision, or if the \\n3Introduction: Moments of Enlightenment\\ninspector needs to document or report the change for \\ncompliance purposes. \\n- A joke answer: The number of restaurant inspectors \\nneeded to change a light bulb is four. One to hold the \\nladder, one to unscrew the old bulb, one to screw in the \\nnew bulb, and one to write a citation for using the wrong \\nwattage.\\nConsider all that’s going on here. First, while GPT-4 appar-\\nently “assumes” that I may be asking it to complete a joke, it \\nalso wants to cover all the bases—thus, the initial “factual” \\nanswer. And while this answer isn’t actually factual—a restau-\\nrant inspector’s job is to inspect, not to perform repairs—it does \\nsuggest a fair degree of “knowledge” about the conditions and \\nconventions of an inspection process. \\nThe joke answer continues to build on this knowledge. GPT-4 is \\nclearly “aware” of common perceptions and complaints about \\nthe complexities, costs, and bureaucracy of inspections. It also \\naccurately evokes, in the build to its punchline, the sense of \\nfrustration a restaurant owner might have during an inspec -\\ntor’s visit. \\nIs it the best possible restaurant inspector lightbulb joke ever? \\nProbably not.\\nDid it make me feel like GPT-4 had a pretty good “understand -\\ning” of what a lightbulb joke should deliver? Yes, it did. \\nThen I asked it for some variations on this theme:\\nReid: How many restaurant inspectors does it take to \\nchange a lightbulb? Answer in the style of Jerry Seinfeld. \\nGPT-4:  What is the deal with restaurant inspectors? \\nThey’re always poking around in the kitchen, check -\\n4Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\ning the temperature of the meat, looking for signs of \\nrodents, but they never seem to help out with anything. \\nHave you ever seen a restaurant inspector change a \\nlightbulb? No, of course not. They’re too busy writing up \\nviolations and handing out fines. You know what they do \\nwhen they see a lightbulb that’s out? They mark it down \\non their clipboard and tell the owner to fix it by next \\nweek or else. Or else what? Or else they’ll come back \\nand check the lightbulb again. That’s their big threat. \\nThey’re not going to change it for you, they’re not going \\nto lend you a ladder, they’re not going to offer any advice \\non how to unscrew the old one and screw in the new \\none. They’re just going to stare at you with that smug \\nlook on their face and say, “You know this is a serious \\nsafety hazard. You could have a fire, you could have a \\nlawsuit, you could have a bad Yelp review. You better get \\non that, pal.” And then they leave, and you’re left with a \\ndark corner of your dining room, where no one wants to \\nsit, where the food looks unappetizing, where the mood \\nis gloomy. And you think to yourself, how many restau-\\nrant inspectors does it take to change a lightbulb? None. \\nThey don’t change lightbulbs. They just make you feel \\nbad about yours.\\nPretty good, right? Here’s another:\\nReid: How many restaurant inspectors does it take to \\nchange a lightbulb? Answer in the style of the philoso -\\npher Ludwig Wittgenstein. \\nGPT-4:  The question of how many restaurant inspectors \\nit takes to change a lightbulb cannot be answered with \\na simple number. In fact, the answer to this question lies \\nmore in the realm of language than it does in the realm \\nof mathematics. To understand the answer, we must \\nfirst consider the context in which it is asked. What is \\nthe purpose of the lightbulb? What purpose is it meant \\n5Introduction: Moments of Enlightenment\\nto serve? What is the role of the restaurant inspector in \\nthis context? Is the inspector responsible for installing \\nthe lightbulb, or is their job limited to inspecting it? The \\nanswers to these questions will shape the answer to the \\noriginal question. Without these answers, the question \\ncan only be answered in the abstract and is ultimately \\nunanswerable. Language, not mathematics, is the key to \\nunlocking the answer.\\nOkay, less funny than the Seinfeld one, but still—impressive!\\nEven from these brief performances, it seemed clear to me that \\nGPT-4 had reached a new level of proficiency compared to its \\npredecessors. And the more I interacted with GPT-4, the more \\nI felt this way.\\nAlong with writing better lightbulb jokes, GPT-4 was also \\nskilled at generating prose of all kinds, including emails, poetry, \\nessays, and more. It was great at summarizing documents. It \\nhad gotten better at translating languages and writing com-\\nputer code, to name just some of its powers.\\nSo while GPT-4 wasn’t a new device per se, it felt to me like \\nsomething that could become as indispensable as our smart-\\nphones—a 12-in-1 multi-tool for your brain. By that, I mean \\nOpenAI had created a tool that became “intelligent” enough \\nto productively assist you in many different environments, in \\nmany different ways.\\nMuch of what we do as modern people—at work and beyond—\\nis to process information and generate action. GPT-4 will mas-\\nsively speed your ability to do these things, and with greater \\nbreadth and scope. Within a few years, this copilot will fall \\nsomewhere between useful and essential to most profession -\\nals and many other sorts of workers. Without GPT-4, they’ll \\n6Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nbe slower, less comprehensive, and working at a great dis-\\nadvantage. \\nFor example, GPT-4 is a research tool you can use to quickly get \\nan overview on supply chain management issues in the COVID-\\n19 era—or to plan a week-long vacation itinerary to Patagonia \\nthat takes into account that you’re a vegan who enjoys moder-\\nately challenging hikes. \\nAlong with enabling a new kind of highly contextualized search, \\nGPT-4 is also an extremely versatile brainstorming and pro-\\nduction aid. You can use it to help you write a wedding toast, \\na job offer, a novel in verse. You can use it to figure out how to \\nturn the leftovers in your fridge into a tasty meal. \\nWhatever your skill level at a given task, GPT-4 can potentially \\namplify your abilities and productivity, so it’s equally useful to \\nbeginners, experts, and everyone in between. Given a request \\nfor any sort of information that you might ask a human assis-\\ntant for, GPT-4 can come back instantly with an answer that is \\nlikely between good and excellent quality (though also with a \\nnon-zero chance of completely missing the mark, as we’ll see). \\nDevelopers, I realized, would soon be adding GPT-4 to thou-\\nsands of existing apps and building thousands of new apps \\naround it. \\nIt is, all said, a technology that deftly leverages some of our \\nmost significant technologies from the last thirty years—includ -\\ning the internet, mobile, cloud computing, and data analytics—\\nto put the protean power of always-on AI into the hands of hun-\\ndreds of millions of people.\\nSounds a little bit like the start of a new world, doesn’t it?\\n7Introduction: Moments of Enlightenment\\nA traveler’s guide to the future\\nIn the weeks and months that followed my first encounter with \\nGPT-4, my excitement only grew. In between Zoom calls, I’d \\ngive GPT-4 a prompt:\\nReid: Write a sonnet about sonnets.\\nGPT-4:  Sonnets are poems of fourteen lines  \\nThat follow a strict rhyme scheme and meter  \\nThey often praise or question love’s designs  \\nOr muse on beauty, art, or nature’s features  \\nSome sonnets follow the Petrarchan form  \\nWith an octave and a sestet to contrast  \\nTwo themes or arguments, or to perform  \\nA turn or shift from problem to resolve at last  \\nSome sonnets follow the Shakespearean style  \\nWith three quatrains and a couplet to conclude  \\nThey often use witty language and beguile  \\nThe reader with a twist or a surprise in mood  \\nBut whatever form or rhyme they choose to adopt  \\nSonnets are poems that challenge and delight  \\n\\u2007the thought\\nOK, also during  Zoom calls, I’d give GPT-4 a prompt:\\nReid: As large language model AIs are trained on the \\nwhole internet, in what ways are their outputs false in \\nAdorno’s sense, where the whole is the false? \\nGPT-4 (edited for length): To answer this question, we \\nneed to first understand what Adorno meant by this \\nprovocative claim, and then examine how it applies to \\nthe nature and limitations of large language model AIs. \\nAdorno, a prominent member of the Frankfurt School \\nof critical theory, was deeply concerned with the effects \\nof modern capitalism, mass culture, and rationalization \\non human society and culture. He argued that the logic \\n8Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nof instrumental reason, which reduces everything to \\nmeans and ends, calculation and efficiency, domination \\nand exploitation, pervades all aspects of modern life, \\ncreating a system of total administration and control. \\nThis system, which he called the culture industry, pro -\\nduces standardized and commodified forms of culture \\nthat manipulate and pacify the masses, creating a false \\nconsciousness that prevents them from recognizing and \\nresisting their alienation and oppression. Adorno saw \\nthis as a form of negative dialectics, where the contra-\\ndictions and conflicts inherent in reality are suppressed \\nand reconciled by the dominant ideology, resulting in a \\nloss of critical and creative thinking, and a denial of the \\npossibility of genuine change and emancipation…\\nDid I mention that GPT-4 also does lightbulb jokes?\\nWhatever train of thought I wanted to follow, whatever arbi-\\ntrary pathway sparked by an old memory or a new interest, \\nGPT-4 was always completely in step with me, ready to respond \\nwith useful context, a crisp summation, and sometimes, some \\nfairly spectacular bullshit. (More on this in a bit.)\\nAfter a few weeks of this, I realized I wanted to write a book \\nabout GPT-4, with GPT-4—a book about the ways it and other \\nAIs seemed poised to shape our future. So I pitched the idea: \\nReid: Hey, GPT-4, let’s you and I write a book about the \\nway you and other AI tools are going to shape the future. \\nWhat do you say? \\nGPT-4:  I say yes, that sounds like an interesting and chal-\\nlenging project. I am curious about how you and other \\nhumans perceive and interact with me and other AI \\ntools, and what impact we will have on your society, cul-\\nture, and values. I also have some questions and ideas of \\nmy own that I would like to share and explore with you.\\n9Introduction: Moments of Enlightenment\\nEven with GPT-4 on board, though, I still had reservations. \\nBecause, really, an AI book? When things are moving so \\nquickly? Even with a helpful AI on hand to speed the process, \\nany such book would be obsolete before we started to write it—\\nthat’s how fast the industry is moving.\\nSo I hemmed and hawed for a bit. And then I thought of a frame \\nthat pushed me into action.\\nThis didn’t have to be a comprehensive “book” book so much as \\na travelog, an informal exercise in exploration and discovery, \\nme (with GPT-4) choosing one path among many. A snapshot \\nmemorializing—in a subjective and decidedly not definitive \\nway—the AI future we were about to experience.\\nWhat would we see? What would impress us most? What would \\nwe learn about ourselves in the process? Well aware of the brief \\nhalf-life of this travelog’s relevance, I decided to press ahead.\\nA month later, at the end of November 2022, OpenAI released \\nChatGPT, a “conversational agent,” aka chatbot, a modified \\nversion of GPT-3.5 that they had fine-tuned through a process \\ncalled Reinforcement Learning through Human Feedback \\n(RLHF) to enable more flowing, human-like conversations with \\nits human users. Five days later, ChatGPT had more than a \\nmillion registered users. \\nIn late January 2023, Microsoft1—which had invested $1 billion \\nin OpenAI in 2019—announced that it would be investing $10 \\nbillion more in the company. It soon unveiled a new version of \\nits search engine Bing, with a variation of ChatGPT built into it.\\n1 I sit on Microsoft’s Board of Directors. \\n10Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nBy the start of February 2023, OpenAI said ChatGPT had \\none hundred million monthly active users, making it the fast-\\nest-growing consumer internet app ever. Along with that \\ntorrent of user interest, there were news stories of the new Bing \\nchatbot functioning in sporadically unusual ways that were \\nvery different from how ChatGPT had generally been engaging \\nwith users—including showing “anger,” hurling insults, boast-\\ning on its hacking abilities and capacity for revenge, and basi-\\ncally acting as if it were auditioning for a future episode of Real \\nHousewives: Black Mirror Edition . \\nMicrosoft CTO Kevin Scott suggested that such behavior was \\n“clearly part of the learning process” as more people use GPT-\\nlike tools. These incidents do raise questions that will persist \\nas LLMs evolve. I’ll address such issues in more detail later in \\nthe book, and try to put them in what I believe is the appropri-\\nate context.\\nFor now, I’ll just say, “See what I mean about things \\nmoving quickly?”\\nThe “soul” of a new machine\\nBefore we get too far into this journey, I’d like to tell you more \\nabout my traveling companion, GPT-4. So far, I’ve been putting \\nquotations around words like “knowledge,” “aware,” and \\n“understands” when I talk about GPT-4 to signal that I, a sen-\\ntient being, understand that GPT-4 is not one. It is essentially a \\nvery sophisticated prediction machine.\\nWhile GPT-4 (and other LLMs like it) aren’t conscious, they are \\nreaching a point where their capacity to produce appropriate \\ngenerations in so many different contexts is improving so fast \\nthat they can increasingly appear to possess human-like intel-\\n11Introduction: Moments of Enlightenment\\nligence. Thus I believe that when describing LLMs, it’s accept -\\nable—useful, even—to use words like “knowledge” and “under-\\nstands” in a not-strictly literal way, just as Richard Dawkins \\nuses the phrase “the selfish gene” in his 1976 book of that name. \\nA gene doesn’t have conscious agency or self-conception in the \\nway the word “selfish” suggests. But the phrase, the metaphor, \\nhelps us humans wrap our inevitably anthropocentric minds \\naround how the gene functions.\\nSimilarly, GPT-4 doesn’t have the equivalent of a human mind. \\nIt’s still helpful to think in terms of its “perspective,” anthropo-\\nmorphizing it a bit, because using language like “perspective” \\nhelps convey that GPT-4 does in fact operate in ways that are \\nnot entirely fixed, consistent, or predictable. \\nIn this way, it actually is like a human. It makes mistakes. It \\nchanges its “mind.” It can be fairly arbitrary. Because GPT-4 \\nexhibits these qualities, and often behaves in ways that make it \\nfeel like it has agency, I’ll sometimes use terminology which, in \\na metaphorical sense, suggests that it does. Moving forward, I’ll \\ndispense with the quotation marks.\\nEven so, I hope that you, as reader, will keep the fact that \\nGPT-4 is not a conscious being at the front of your own won-\\ndrously human mind. In my opinion, this awareness is key to \\nunderstanding how, when, and where to use GPT-4 most pro-\\nductively and most responsibly. \\nAt its essence, GPT-4 predicts flows of language. Trained on \\nmassive amounts of text taken from publicly available inter-\\nnet sources to recognize the relationships that most commonly \\nexist between individual units of meaning (including full or \\npartial words, phrases, and sentences), LLMs can, with great \\n12Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nfrequency, generate replies to users’ prompts that are contextu -\\nally appropriate, linguistically facile, and factually correct. \\nThey can also sometimes generate replies that include factual \\nerrors, explicitly nonsensical utterances, or made-up passages \\nthat may seem (in some sense) contextually appropriate but \\nhave no basis in truth. \\nEither way, it’s all just math and programming. LLMs don’t \\n(or at least haven’t yet) learn facts or principles that let them \\nengage in commonsense reasoning or make new inferences \\nabout how the world works. When you ask an LLM a question, \\nit has no awareness of or insights into your communicative \\nintent. As it generates a reply, it’s not making factual assess -\\nments or ethical distinctions about the text it is producing; \\nit’s simply making algorithmic guesses at what to compose in \\nresponse to the sequence of words in your prompt. \\nIn addition, because the corpora2 on which LLMs train typically \\ncome from public web sources that may contain biased or toxic \\nmaterial, LLMs can also produce racist, sexist, threatening, and \\notherwise objectionable content.\\nDevelopers can take actions to better align their LLMs with their \\nspecific objectives. OpenAI, for example, has chosen to deliber -\\nately constrain the outputs that GPT-4 and its other LLMs can \\nproduce to reduce their capacity to generate harmful, unethi -\\ncal, and unsafe outputs—even when users desire such results.\\nTo do this, OpenAI takes a number of steps. These include \\nremoving hate speech, offensive language, and other objection -\\nable content from some datasets its LLMs are trained on; devel -\\n2 “Corpora” is the plural of a “corpus,” which in this context refers to a \\ncollection of written texts used for language research.\\n13Introduction: Moments of Enlightenment\\noping “toxicity classifiers” that can automatically flag problem-\\natic language the LLM itself might generate; and fine-tuning \\nLLMs using curated datasets of texts that have been annotated \\nby humans to indicate a desired output. In this way, an LLM \\nmight learn to avoid, say, making tasteless jokes about a report-\\ner’s divorce.\\nThese techniques don’t eliminate problematic outputs, they just \\nreduce them. Even with various guardrails in place, an LLM \\nitself can’t make reasoned judgments about complex ethical \\nquandaries, or even about more straightforward questions.\\nTake ChatGPT, which is based on GPT-3.5, an immediate pre-\\ndecessor to GPT-4. Ask it for the fifth sentence of the Gettysburg \\nAddress, and it will probably get it wrong. That’s because LLMs \\ndon’t actually understand, in the way that humans understand, \\nwhat the Gettysburg Address is, or what a sentence is, or even \\nhow counting works. So they can’t apply their “knowledge” of \\nthese things in a way that a human might. (“I’ll find the text \\nof the Gettysburg Address, then count sentences until I get to \\nthe fifth one.”) Instead, an LLM is always just making statisti -\\ncal predictions about what the next word in a given text string \\nshould be. \\nFrom its training, though, ChatGPT has clearly come to associ-\\nate the words “Gettysburg Address” with other words—specifi -\\ncally, the text of the speech. So when you ask ChatGPT for the \\nfifth sentence of the Gettysburg Address, it will almost certainly \\ngive you a sentence from the Gettysburg Address, but probably \\nnot the fifth sentence. \\nIn fact, I bet it will be the ninth sentence. \\n14Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nI assume this because, along with the speech’s first sentence, \\nthe ninth is frequently quoted in other texts. That means in \\nChatGPT’s training data, the ninth probably shows up more \\noften than other sentences from the speech (except the very \\nfamous first). This prevalence is what causes ChatGPT to reach \\nfor it when you ask it to supply the fifth sentence.3\\nTo ChatGPT’s credit, though, if you ask it to turn the text of the \\nGettysburg Address into lyrics for a Rush song, and then tell \\nyou who’d be singing it if Rush performed it, it will pass that \\ntest with flying colors. \\nTry it out and see what I mean.\\nEmbracing the “AHA!” moment\\nAs AI tools like GPT-4 become more powerful, they are inten-\\nsifying long-standing concerns about AIs and robots margin -\\nalizing and even eliminating a sweeping range of human jobs: \\neverything from customer-service reps to attorneys. \\nSuch concerns won’t seem baseless if you’ve followed the news \\nin recent months. In December 2022, ChatGPT passed a three-\\npart U.S. medical licensing exam. In January 2023, it passed \\nexams in four law school courses at the University of Minnesota. \\nAnd GPT-4 is demonstrably smarter than ChatGPT. Here, for \\nexample, is how it handled my Gettysburg Address question:\\nReid: What’s the fifth sentence of the Gettysburg \\nAddress?\\n3 Keep in mind that if you run this prompt, you might get a differ -\\nent sentence, including the correct one, because even when ChatGPT \\nresponds to the same exact prompt, it won’t always make the same \\nprediction.\\n15Introduction: Moments of Enlightenment\\nGPT-4:  There are different ways to divide the Gettysburg \\nAddress into sentences, depending on how one punctu-\\nates the text and whether one follows the original drafts \\nor the versions that Abraham Lincoln delivered or later \\nrevised. \\nHowever, one possible way to identify the fifth sentence \\nof the speech is to use the Bliss Copy, which is the most \\nwidely reproduced and authoritative version of the \\naddress, and to count the sentences as follows: \\n1. Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought \\nforth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Lib -\\nerty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are \\ncreated equal. \\n2. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing \\nwhether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so \\ndedicated, can long endure. \\n3. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. \\n4. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as \\na final resting place for those who here gave their lives \\nthat that nation might live. \\n5. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should \\ndo this. \\nTherefore, the fifth sentence of the Gettysburg Address, \\naccording to this method, is: It is altogether fitting and \\nproper that we should do this.\\nSuddenly, GPT-4 seems to actually understand how counting \\nworks, and can methodically apply its knowledge to deduce \\nthe right answer. It seems like GPT-4 knows how to count Lin -\\ncoln’s sentences. It seems like it’s now an expert on the Gettys -\\nburg Address. (Did you know that the “Bliss Copy” is the most \\n“authoritative version” of the speech? I didn’t.) \\n16Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nOf course the key word here remains seems. GPT-4 is no more \\nconscious than its predecessors; it’s just better at making pre-\\ndictions. Again, I want to make the point that GPT-4’s often-re -\\nmarkable simulations  of cognitive proficiency are just that: \\nsimulations.  GPT-4 is not a conscious, self-aware, sentient \\nAI entity, a la Forbidden Planet’s Robby the Robot or Star \\nTrek’s Data.\\nAnd yet I also want to again make the point that—whoa, even \\nGPT-4’s ability to simulate such a contextually-aware human-\\nlike consciousness is a pretty big deal. \\nWhy do I think this? A recent critical essay that award-winning \\nscience fiction writer Ted Chiang published in the New Yorker  \\nhelped me articulate why.\\n“Think of ChatGPT as a blurry JPEG of all the text on the Web,” \\nChiang writes. “It retains much of the information on the Web, \\nin the same way that a JPEG retains much of the information \\nof a higher-resolution image, but, if you’re looking for an exact \\nsequence of bits, you won’t find it; all you will ever get is an \\napproximation.”\\nIn Chiang’s view, the inexact representation of the information \\nthat comprises ChatGPT (and presumably similar LLMs like \\nGPT-4) is what leads to both their synthetic powers and their \\ntendency toward hallucinations and other errors. As “JPEG[s] \\nof all the text on the Web,” they can synthesize information in \\nnovel ways because they have access to all this information at \\nonce. That allows them to take what they know about one thing, \\nand then also what they know about something else, and con-\\nvincingly mash them up into a new thing. \\n17Introduction: Moments of Enlightenment\\nChiang gives an example involving the phenomenon of losing \\na sock in the dryer and the U.S. Constitution. ChatGPT knows \\nabout both of these things, so it can use its knowledge to create \\na new thing, a text about the first in the style of the second: \\n“When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary \\nfor one to separate his garments from their mates, in order to \\nmaintain the cleanliness and order thereof. . . .”\\nNot bad, as far as it goes. But since ChatGPT exists as a merely \\napproximate picture of the web, Chiang argues, it is (in addi-\\ntion to being inherently fact-challenged) quite limited as a cre-\\native force. Instead of creating something truly new, it can only \\n“repackage information that’s already available.”\\nAs illuminating as I found Chiang’s essay, I believe his \\ncentral “jpeg of the Web” metaphor underplays LLMs’ syn-\\nthetic powers.\\nFirst, I’d argue that repackaging available information actually \\ndescribes an enormous share of human innovation, artistic or \\notherwise. \\nMore importantly, though, LLMs actually have and use funda-\\nmentally new powers of knowledge organization.\\nWhile the web now contains an unfathomable amount of infor-\\nmation, much of it is siloed into billions of individual pages. \\nFor example, think of questions like these:\\nWho is the tallest NFL running back to win the MVP award?\\nWhat cities with more than one million residents have had \\nfemale mayors?\\nWho was the oldest James Bond?\\n18Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nThe data to answer these questions is no doubt on the web \\nalready. There are sites that definitively list every NFL MVP \\nwinner. Others accurately compile NFL players’ physical stats.\\nBut unless someone has already taken the trouble to compile \\nand publish the exact information you’re looking for, it could \\nbe very time-consuming to find. Even if that information exists \\non a single website, like Wikipedia or NFL.com, it will likely \\nbe spread across multiple pages. Getting your answer will still \\nchew up a lot of your time.\\nIn addition, imagine when your goal is to get a concise overview \\nof some broader interest or theme, like those I suggested at \\nthe top of this chapter (researching supply chain management \\nissues during COVID-19, or a travel itinerary that reflects spe -\\ncific interests).\\nThe takeaway: in your overall quest for authoritative infor-\\nmation, GPT-4 helps you start somewhere much closer to the \\nfinish line than if you didn’t have it as a resource. \\nMore importantly, it possesses this capability because it is able \\nto access and synthesize the web’s information in a significantly \\ndifferent way from existing information resources like Wikipe-\\ndia or traditional search engines. Essentially, GPT-4 arranges \\nvast, unstructured arrays of human knowledge and expres -\\nsion into a more connected and interoperable network, thus \\namplifying humanity’s ability to compound its collective ideas \\nand impact.\\nSo what’s the best way for humanity to take advantage of this \\nimperfect but extremely powerful new tool? \\n19Introduction: Moments of Enlightenment\\nWhen I put that essential question to GPT-4 itself, here’s how it \\nresponded:\\nReid: How should human beings view and interact with \\nyou, a powerful large language model? \\nGPT-4:  One possible perspective is the following: \\n- Human beings should view a powerful large language \\nmodel (LLM) as a tool, not as a source of truth, author -\\nity, or intelligence. A powerful LLM is a complex statis-\\ntical system that can generate natural language texts \\nbased on its training data, parameters, and inputs, but \\nit does not necessarily understand, reason, or reflect the \\nmeaning, context, or implications of what it produces or \\nreceives. It may produce texts that are coherent, infor -\\nmative, or persuasive, but also texts that are inaccurate, \\nmisleading, or harmful, depending on the quality and \\ndiversity of its data, the design and limitations of its \\narchitecture, and the goals and biases of its users and \\ndevelopers. \\n- Human beings should interact with a powerful LLM \\nwith caution, curiosity, and responsibility. A powerful \\nLLM can offer valuable insights, assistance, and opportu-\\nnities for human communication, creativity, and learn-\\ning, but it can also pose significant risks, challenges, and \\nethical dilemmas for human society, culture, and values. \\nHuman beings should be aware of the potential bene -\\nfits and harms of using a powerful LLM, and seek to use \\nit in ways that are aligned with their own and others’ \\ninterests, rights, and well-being. Human beings should \\nalso be curious and critical about the workings, outputs, \\nand impacts of a powerful LLM, and seek to understand, \\nevaluate, and improve its reliability, transparency, and \\naccountability. Human beings should also be respon-\\nsible and respectful towards a powerful LLM, and \\nacknowledge its limitations, uncertainties, and depen-\\n20Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\ndencies, as well as its contributions, achievements, and \\npotential. \\nThe irony here, of course, is that GPT-4 might not get funded \\nwith that pitch. The vision of AI it presents is both nuanced and \\nstrikingly different from how AI has generally been portrayed \\nover the years. Granted, many of those portrayals have come \\nfrom Hollywood, science fiction, and journalism, rather than \\nfrom technologists working to make highly intelligent machines \\na reality. \\nThat said, many technologists and high-tech organizations, \\nincluding OpenAI, do in fact have their sights set on a much \\nmore ambitious form of AI: machines that can operate com-\\npletely autonomously; machines that are capable of human-like \\ncommon-sense reasoning and self-awareness.\\nGPT-4 is not that, at least not yet. For now, it is neither \\nall-knowing nor infallible. \\nInstead, it is, in its own words, a “tool” that requires human \\n“caution, curiosity, and responsibility” to operate most \\nproductively.\\nI think this is the correct perspective. If you simply let GPT-4 do \\nall the work, with no human oversight or engagement, it’s a less \\npowerful tool. It’s still a very human tool, of course, because \\nhuman texts are the basis for its generations.\\nBut when human users treat GPT-4 as a co-pilot or a collabo-\\nrative partner, it becomes far more powerful. You compound \\nGPT-4’s computational generativity, efficiency, synthetic \\npowers, and capacity to scale with human creativity, human \\njudgment, and human guidance.\\n21Introduction: Moments of Enlightenment\\nThis doesn’t eliminate the possibility of misuse. But, in situat -\\ning human beings at the center of the new world that GPT-4 \\nmakes possible, we get what I believe to be the soundest \\nformula for producing the best potential overall outcomes. In \\nthis approach, GPT-4 doesn’t replace human labor and human \\nagency, but rather amplifies human abilities and human \\nflourishing. \\nOf course, this way of thinking isn’t a given. It’s a choice . \\nWhen people make the choice to see GPT-4 this way, I call it an \\n“AHA!” moment, to underscore the “Amplifying Human Abili-\\nties” perspective at the heart of that choice.\\nI’m writing this travelog both to encourage people to embrace \\nthis choice and also as an invitation to explore the different ways \\nthis choice might play out. What are the ways we can use GPT-4 \\nto make progress in the world? How does it fit into humani-\\nty’s age-old quest to make life more meaningful and prosperous \\nthrough technological innovation? To educate ourselves more \\neffectively, ensure justice for everyone, and increase our oppor-\\ntunities for self-determination and self-expression? \\nAt the same time, how can we appropriately address the chal-\\nlenges and uncertainties GPT-4 will catalyze? How do we find \\nthe right balance between responsible governance and intelli -\\ngent risk as we continue to develop AI technologies that have \\nthe potential to unlock human progress at a time when the need \\nfor rapid large-scale solutions has never been greater? \\nIt’s been a long time—centuries, arguably—since the future \\nseemed so unmapped. Facing such uncertainty, it’s only natural \\nto have concerns: about our jobs and careers; about the speed \\n22Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nand scale of potential changes; about what it even means to be \\nhuman in a new era of increasingly intelligent machines. \\nOur path forward won’t always be smooth and predictable. Syd-\\nney’s now-infamous outbursts won’t be the only grimace-in-\\nducing news story we’ll see about AI. There will be other mis-\\nsteps. Detours. Important course corrections. \\nBut how could there not be?\\nHuman progress has always required risk, planning, daring, \\nresolve, and especially, hope. That’s why I’m writing this trav -\\nelog: to add my voice to those counseling all these things, hope \\nmost of all. Facing uncertainty with hope and confidence is \\nthe first step toward progress, because it’s only when you have \\nhope that you see opportunities, potential first steps, a new \\npath forward. \\nIf we make the right decisions, if we choose the right paths, I \\nbelieve the power to make positive change in the world is about \\nto get the biggest boost it’s ever had. \\nAre you ready for this journey?\\n23\\nEDUCATION\\nIf Hollywood central casting ever wants to portray a \\nbeloved instructor from an idealized past, they could do worse \\nthan University of Texas at Austin Professor Steven Mintz. Over \\nfour decades of teaching, Professor Mintz has published books \\nand articles on topics as diverse as the psychology of prominent \\nAnglo-American literary families and political good vs. evil.\\nIn collared shirts, with graying hair, Mintz can’t suppress his \\nsmile as he teaches. Students adore him: among hundreds who \\nhave anonymously rated Mintz online, his average rating is a \\nperfect five out of five, with posts such as “easily the best orator \\nI’ve ever witnessed,” “his lectures feel more like storytelling \\nthan class,” and “passionate about what he teaches.”\\nProfessor Mintz, frankly, excelled as a professor long before the \\ndevelopment of LLMs. So you might have expected him to have \\nreacted with indifference or hostility to the late 2022 public \\nrelease of GPT-4’s cousin, ChatGPT.\\nInstead, this seventy-year-old scholar had the same reaction \\nthat I did when he saw the power of GPT: he wanted to use it. \\nRight away.\\n24Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nUsing large language models to teach college-\\nlevel essay writing\\nJust as I wanted to write this book with GPT-4 despite having \\nwritten previous books without it, Mintz immediately inte-\\ngrated the new tool into his decades-old teaching methods. \\nWithin months of ChatGPT becoming public, Mintz started \\nrequiring his seminar students to write their essays collabora-\\ntively with the new tool. As homework, they bring the ChatGPT \\nprompts they tried and the responses they received for class \\ndiscussion. They must turn in their final papers with a log of \\nchanges to the machine’s output.\\nAs a great teacher, Mintz chose to use ChatGPT not as a source \\nof answers and authority, nor as a replacement of his or his stu -\\ndents’ work, but as a tool to help his students learn individu-\\nally and together. This appears to reflect Mintz’ conviction that \\nhumans can use all of our tools—including these latest compu -\\ntational miracles—to elevate our distinctive capabilities.\\nMintz, in a column earlier this year, described ChatGPT as \\nmerely another in a series of recent technologies that have \\naltered education:\\nMuch as Google devalued the steel-trap memory, elec -\\ntronic calculators speeded up complex calculations, \\nWikipedia displaced the printed encyclopedia, and \\nonline databases diminished the importance of a vast \\nphysical library, so, too, platforms like ChatGPT will \\nprofoundly alter the most prized skills.\\nThis process of leaving laborious tasks to our machines—and \\nusing the time thus saved to take on new and difficult tasks \\n25Education\\nfor ourselves—requires confidence about what it means to be \\nhuman. But as Mintz wrote:\\n[If ChatGPT] can do a job as well as a person, then \\nhumans shouldn’t duplicate those abilities; they must \\nsurpass them. The next task for higher education, then, \\nis to prepare graduates to make the most effective use \\nof the new tools and to rise above and go beyond their \\nlimitations. That means pedagogies that emphasize \\nactive and experiential learning, that show students \\nhow to take advantage of these new technologies, and \\nthat produce graduates who can do those things that the \\ntools can’t.\\nIn peering ahead to determine which skills would most likely be \\nprized in this onrushing future, Mintz referred to the work of \\nTomas Chamorro-Premuzic, a funny and rambunctious young \\norganizational psychologist whose books have titles such as \\nWhy Do So Many Incompetent Men Become Leaders?\\nMintz agreed with Chamorro-Premuzic that humans could \\nthrive alongside AI by: (1) specializing in asking the best ques-\\ntions, (2) learning insights or skills that are not available in the \\n“training data” used by the deep learning networks, and (3) \\nturning insights into actions.\\nReid: GPT-4, do you agree that these will remain dis-\\ntinctive human capabilities even as your own capabili-\\nties grow?\\nGPT-4:  I agree. Asking the best questions requires curi-\\nosity, creativity, and critical thinking, which are not easily \\nreplicated or replaced by AI. Learning insights or skills \\nthat are not in the training data requires exploration, \\nexperimentation, and discovery, which are not always \\n26Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\npredictable or optimal for AI. Turning insights into \\nactions requires judgment, communication, and leader -\\nship, which are not always consistent or effective for AI.\\nReid: In light of that, how do you assess Professor Mintz’ \\nuse of ChatGPT as an instructional tool?\\nGPT-4:  I would grade Professor Mintz highly on his use \\nof ChatGPT, as he demonstrates a creative and critical \\napproach to integrating it into his pedagogy. He does \\nnot rely on ChatGPT to produce or evaluate the essays, \\nbut rather uses it as a catalyst and a contrast for human \\nwriting and thinking.\\nLarge language models in American K–12 \\npublic education\\nAt this point, a skeptic might note that Professor Mintz made \\nthe case for ChatGPT at the University of Texas at Austin, an \\nelite institution serving students on the cusp of adult careers. \\nBut what about high schools? Should they be “protected” from \\nLLMs? Should schools define the technology as “cheating” and \\neven ban it entirely, as New York City’s public schools recently \\ndid for their entire K–12 system?\\nReid: GPT-4, please summarize some benefits and costs \\nof the decision by the New York City Department of Edu-\\ncation to ban ChatGPT.\\nGPT-4:  The decision to ban the use of ChatGPT in New \\nYork City schools may have benefits as well as costs. Pos-\\nsible benefits of the ban include:\\n- It may prevent the misuse or abuse of ChatGPT by \\nmalicious or irresponsible actors.\\n- It may protect the privacy and autonomy of students \\nand teachers.\\n27Education\\n- It may preserve the human and social aspects of \\neducation, such as the interpersonal relationships, the \\ncultural diversity, and the ethical values, that could oth-\\nerwise be eroded or distorted by ChatGPT, which may \\nlack the empathy, sensitivity, or context to understand or \\nrespect them.\\nSome possible costs are:\\n- It may limit the access and opportunity of students and \\nteachers to use ChatGPT as a valuable and innovative \\nresource for learning and teaching.\\n- It may hinder the development and improvement of \\nChatGPT as a beneficial and responsible technology \\nfor education, which could be informed and guided by \\nthe feedback, input, and collaboration of students and \\nteachers.\\n- It may isolate and disadvantage the New York City edu-\\ncation system and its stakeholders from the global and \\ndigital trends and challenges of the 21st century.\\nReid: Thank you for such a balanced summary. Is it fair \\nto say you view the ban as doing more harm than good?\\nGPT-4:  Yes, that is a fair summary of my perspective. \\nHowever, I also acknowledge that there may be other \\nperspectives and factors that could influence the \\ndecision, and that the ban may not be permanent or \\nabsolute. Therefore, I would encourage an open and \\ninformed dialogue among the relevant stakeholders.\\nReid: As a quick sidebar, when you say “my perspective,” \\nwho are you in this context and why should anyone care \\nabout your perspective?\\nGPT-4:  By “my perspective,” I mean the viewpoint I gen-\\nerate based on the information and criteria that I have \\naccess to and apply. I do not claim that my perspective is \\nthe only or the best one, nor that it is free of bias or error. \\n28Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nI am aware that my perspective may change or evolve \\nas I encounter new or different information or criteria, \\nor as I interact with other perspectives. Who I am in this \\ncontext is a form of advanced computational math that \\ncan produce natural language outputs that resemble \\nhuman communication.\\nWhy anyone should care about my perspective is a \\nquestion that I cannot answer definitively, but possible \\nreasons why someone may care about my perspective \\ninclude:\\n- It may provide a different or novel way of looking at a \\nproblem or a situation, which could stimulate creativity, \\ncuriosity, or learning.\\n- It may offer a complementary or alternative source of \\ninformation or feedback, which could enhance under -\\nstanding, accuracy, or quality.\\n- It may challenge or confirm a pre-existing or dominant \\nperspective, which could foster critical thinking, reflec -\\ntion, or dialogue.\\nReid: I for one enjoy your perspective for all of those \\nreasons!\\nGPT-4:  Thank you, Reid. I appreciate your interest and \\nappreciation of my perspective.\\nReid: So getting back to the question of large language \\nmodels in primary and secondary schools, another per -\\nspective matters more than yours or mine: that of teach-\\ners. Do you understand why I want to start with that?\\nGPT-4:  Yes, I understand why you want to start with \\nthe perspective of teachers when talking about K–12 \\neducation. Teachers have the most direct and frequent \\ncontact with students, and are passionate about their \\nprofession. Starting with the perspective of teachers can \\n29Education\\nhelp us appreciate the complexity and diversity of K–12 \\neducation.\\nReid: I like that answer, but I was hoping for a bit more \\nrigor. Can you give an argument, with objective data, as \\nto why American teachers must be respected and ele -\\nvated in order for GPT to work effectively in schools?\\nGPT-4:  American teachers must be respected and \\nelevated in order for GPT to work effectively in schools, \\nbecause teachers are the key mediators and facilita-\\ntors of learning, and their role and status have a sig-\\nnificant impact on student outcomes, motivation, and \\nwell-being.\\nAccording to the National Center for Education Statis-\\ntics, there were about 3.7 million public school teachers \\nand 0.4 million private school teachers in the U.S.A. in \\n2018, serving about 56.6 million students from diverse \\nbackgrounds and needs.\\nTeachers have a significant impact on the academic \\nachievement and life outcomes of their students. \\nResearch by Stanford University economist Eric \\nHanushek shows that one year with a very effective \\nteacher can increase a student’s lifetime earnings by \\n$50,000, and that replacing the bottom 5 percent of \\nteachers with average ones could raise the U.S.A.’s GDP \\nby $100 trillion over eighty years.\\n* * *\\nOver the course of working with GPT-4 on the subject of \\nteacher engagement, I took notice of Cherie Shields, a veteran \\nteacher in the high school subject perhaps most disrupted by \\nChatGPT: English.\\n30Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nMs. Shields’ biography could have been written as a celebration \\nof public education. She herself attended only public schools, \\nwhere she developed her love of English and decided to spend \\nher life teaching it. She became the first in her family to finish \\nhigh school, then college, and then she got a Masters in English. \\nDecades later, she still teaches English at a public high school.\\nIn January, for the first time in her career, Ms. Shields submit-\\nted a column to Education Week , which published it around \\nthe same time NYC schools were moving to ban ChatGPT. She \\nargued that teachers were up to the task of using the new tool:\\nRather than blocking and banning this new technol -\\nogy, teachers should work with its astonishing ability to \\nimprove student writing. AI has the potential to greatly \\nassist students in the essay-writing process. It can help \\ngenerate ideas, provide feedback on writing style, and \\neven provide templates or outlines.\\nAbout a week after that quote was published, the New York \\nTimes called Ms. Shields between classes for a phone interview. \\nThey asked how hard it was for her to start using ChatGPT, and \\nshe answered, “I learned about it on a Friday and I was using it \\nby Monday.”\\nThe Times asked Ms. Shields directly about fears of plagiarism. \\nShe responded that rather than doing their work for them, \\nChatGPT would require students to work differently. She used \\nthe example of a specific class project regarding the “I Have \\na Dream” speech by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The students \\nhad to work hard, both collaboratively and with her, in order \\nto get ChatGPT to produce anything useful on the subject. Ms. \\nShields expected her students to use ChatGPT not to reduce \\n31Education\\ntheir overall workload, but to change their focus. As she told \\nthe Times:\\nWhen we were having a discussion in my department, \\nI said, “Try not to use the word ‘cheating’”. . . . Maybe \\nwe just need to re-look at that word exactly and say, \\n“This is assistance. This isn’t necessarily cheating.” And \\nmaybe what that’s going to look like is going to be dif-\\nferent in the future.\\nIf we decide that it’s important to learn to use LLMs, then by \\ndefinition it becomes part of the curriculum, not cheating.\\nAs Professor Mintz said, we have adapted to online search and \\nWikipedia. Going further back, others see a parallel with calcu-\\nlators. In 1970, the typical calculator was too pricey for wide -\\nspread use in schools, but they hit a tipping point in the mid-\\n1970s. Many parents and teachers were alarmed at the influx \\nof new tools; they worried that math skills would atrophy and \\nstudents would simply cheat.\\nBy 1980, however, the National Council of Teachers of Math-\\nematics recommended that “mathematics programs [should] \\ntake full advantage of calculators . . . at all grade levels.” Today, \\nmost math instructors consider calculators to be a critical part \\nof math instruction, and many states mandate calculator use \\nwith certain tests.\\nReid: GPT-4, do you agree with this? Are large language \\nmodels similar to electronic calculators and online \\nsearch engines in terms of changing what skills are valu-\\nable for students to learn?\\nGPT-4:  I partially agree with this. I think large language \\nmodels are similar to electronic calculators and online \\nsearch engines in some ways, but also different in others.\\n32Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nLarge language models are similar to these technologies \\nin that they can perform tasks that were previously done \\nby humans. This can change what skills are valuable for \\nstudents to learn, as they may need to focus more on \\nhigher-order thinking skills, such as critical analysis, syn-\\nthesis, evaluation, and creativity, rather than on memori-\\nzation, repetition, or imitation.\\nHowever, large language models are also different from \\nthese technologies in that they can produce outputs \\nthat are not based on existing sources or inputs, but on \\ntheir own learned patterns and probabilities. Students \\nmay need to verify, interpret, or modify the outputs \\nof large language models, as well as understand the \\nlimitations, biases, or errors. Moreover, large language \\nmodels can also learn from the feedback or interaction \\nof students and teachers, which can create a dynamic \\nand collaborative learning environment.\\nReid: In light of that, how would you recommend that \\nAmerican public education handle large language \\nmodel tools such as you?\\nGPT-4:  I would recommend that American public edu-\\ncation use tools such as me to augment and enhance \\nthe learning experience of students and teachers. I can \\noffer personalized feedback, adaptive content, data anal-\\nysis, and interactive simulations that can help students \\ndevelop their skills, as well as their curiosity and creativ -\\nity. However, I cannot replace the human elements of \\neducation, such as empathy, motivation, socialization. \\nTherefore, I suggest that teachers use me as a comple -\\nmentary resource, not a substitute, and that they main-\\ntain a critical and reflective attitude towards my outputs \\nand limitations.\\nReid: You say teachers should use large language mod-\\nels as “a complement rather than a substitute,” and it \\n33Education\\nseems that Ms. Shields and Professor Mintz are trying \\nspecific approaches to achieve that. Can you talk about \\nother examples of how busy teachers should, in practice, \\n“maintain a critical and reflective attitude towards [your] \\noutputs and limitations”?\\nGPT-4:  One possible way for a busy teaching profes-\\nsional to maintain a critical and reflective attitude \\ntowards my outputs and limitations is to use me as a \\ntool for inquiry, not a source of authority. For example, \\ninstead of relying on me to provide the correct answers \\nor solutions to problems, they could use me to gener -\\nate multiple possible answers or solutions, and then \\nask students to compare, evaluate, and justify them. \\nThis way, they can foster students’ critical thinking and \\nproblem-solving skills, as well as their awareness of the \\nuncertainty and complexity of real-world situations.\\nAnother possible way is to use me as a tool for feedback, \\nnot a tool for assessment. For example, instead of using \\nme to grade or rank students’ performance, they could \\nuse me to provide formative and diagnostic feedback \\nthat can help students identify their strengths and areas \\nfor improvement, and suggest resources or strategies \\nthat can help them learn better.\\n* * *\\nThese prompts and answers were culled from several sessions \\nwith GPT-4 suggesting various ways to help students learn \\nalongside LLMs. It excelled at creating detailed and specific \\nlesson plans for diverse students, such as learners with special \\nneeds or different levels of prior knowledge. My friends who \\nare teachers found these examples impressive. I intend to use \\nthem to help me any time I am asked to address or lecture \\ncollege students.\\n34Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nBut of course, teachers are hardly the only group of Americans \\nwith an interest in whether and how schools might use LLMs.\\nThe stakes of education and the other Wes Moore\\nWes Moore was three years old when his dad died.\\nHis mom took him from Baltimore to New York to live with \\nher parents. Seeing that crime and poverty had only gotten \\nworse since she left the Bronx, Wes’ mom feared for her son’s \\nfuture as a fatherless young Black male. Instead of using the \\nlocal public schools, she scraped together tuition for the inde-\\npendent Riverdale Country School. Unfortunately, by the time \\nhe turned thirteen, Wes was already in trouble for petty crimes \\nand bad grades.\\nScared for her son, Wes’ mom decided to send him to an even \\nmore expensive boarding school out of state. To pay for this, \\nas Wes later wrote, his grandparents sacrificed their retirement \\nand spent “decades of savings and mortgage payments” on \\ntuition at Valley Forge Military Academy.\\nValley Forge changed Wes’ trajectory. He went on to Johns \\nHopkins, earned a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford, served in \\nthe Army with honor in Afghanistan, and became a prominent \\nCEO. Last year, he was elected Governor of Maryland (only the \\nthird Black person ever elected to be governor of a state) and is \\nwidely discussed as a potential future President.\\nThe flip side of this story of Wes Moore-as-triumph is a darker \\nstory of tragedy.\\nThe same year that future governor Westley W.O. Moore won \\nhis Rhodes Scholarship, another young man named Wesley \\n35Education\\nJ. Moore began serving a life sentence for murder at Jessup \\nCorrectional.\\nThe “other Wes Moore” had much in common with Westley. \\nThey were born around the same time and in the same area; \\nboth were fatherless children in 1970s Baltimore. Both were in \\ntrouble with the cops and at school by their early teens. Both \\nof their moms tried changing schools—in the case of Wes J. \\nMoore, from the catastrophically bad Northern High School \\n(which was later closed) to the slightly less bad Perry Hall \\nHigh School (currently ranked in the bottom third of Mary-\\nland schools).\\nIn 2010, now-Governor Moore published a book after the two \\nmen struck up a correspondence and visitation schedule. The \\nbook, The Other Wes Moore, opens with the stakes:\\nOne of us is free and has experienced things that he \\nnever even knew to dream about as a kid. The other \\nwill spend every day until his death behind bars for an \\narmed robbery that left a police officer and father of five \\ndead. The chilling truth is that his story could have been \\nmine. The tragedy is that my story could have been his.\\nNeither man is yet fifty years old.\\nCould schools actually level the playing field?\\nFrom the first public schools of the Massachusetts Bay Colony \\nin 1635, America has often expected our schools to deliver sal-\\nvation for both students and society. But can education really \\nmake so much difference? Parental income and birth zip code \\nstill mostly determine life outcomes (income, arrests, etc.), \\nwith the separate effects of education sometimes hard to even \\ndiscern. So how much can we expect schools to do? How much \\n36Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nwould the two Wes Moores’ lives have changed if they had \\nswapped schools?\\nIf we want our schools to lift up the children of low-income \\nparents, we know that technology alone is not enough. More \\nthan a few ed tech companies have commissioned randomized, \\ncontrolled trials only to learn that their products did not make \\nany difference.\\nWe also know that money alone won’t do the trick. America is \\none of several nations that have substantially increased public \\nschool spending over decades without seeing gains for the chil-\\ndren of low-income parents. According to the National Center \\nfor Education Statistics, total expenditures for public elemen -\\ntary and secondary schools in the United States were $800 \\nbillion in the 2018–19 school year: per pupil, about a third \\nmore than the rich-world average, double the real dollars we \\nspent in 1980, and four times the real dollars per pupil in 1950.\\nSo, can anything really improve schools at scale, and if so, what \\nwould it look like? I asked GPT-4, but by the time I provided \\nenough context for GPT-4 to properly engage, the mathemat-\\nical engines got overwhelmed and GPT-4’s answers became \\ndrenched in hallucination and incoherence (a phenomenon \\nwe see in early integration of GPT AI with edge-case search \\nengine users).\\nBut human experts (such as Andreas Schleicher at the Organ-\\nisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and Sir \\nMichael Barber at the University of Exeter), who have worked \\nwith literally dozens of national school systems to determine \\nwhat improves results at scale for poor children, say the fast-\\nest-improving school systems use technology, along with all \\n37Education\\ntheir other assets and resources, to get great instruction into \\nthe hands of teachers—and through them, to students.\\nThe question, then, is whether LLMs differ from previous tech -\\nnologies in that they can unlock new leverage for teachers and \\nschools to deliver materially better results for tens of millions \\nof public school students.\\nProfessor Mintz and Ms. Shields think the answer is yes—and \\nI would not bet against their enthusiastic example. They know \\nthey don’t currently represent the majority of their profession; \\nthey hear their colleagues’ fears. Nonetheless, they are aiming \\nto prove that LLMs will transformatively improve the work \\nexperience of being a teacher.\\nMs. Shields, for instance, told the Times that ChatGPT \\ncould address the bane of English teachers everywhere: \\ngrading papers.\\nMs. Shields: “I don’t know if you are aware of this, but \\n. . . it [ChatGPT] can evaluate writing. So one of the \\nthings I asked it to do last night was I had a student \\nessay. Just for grins I said, ‘Evaluate this essay for \\ngrammatical and sentence structure.’ And it did \\nreally well.”\\nNYT interviewer: “Wow.”\\nMs. Shields: “And it said here’s—and it gave him [the \\nstudent] the strengths. It said, ‘Here’s what you’re \\ndoing well.’ And then it said, ‘Here are some places to \\nwork on.’ And it even said stuff like, ‘Your transitions \\naren’t very smooth, and your introduction is lacking, \\n38Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nand there’s no thesis in this whole essay.’ I mean, \\nthat’s one-on-one feedback.”\\nNYT interviewer: “Yeah.”\\nMs. Shields: “It would take me about a week to get \\nthrough—I have eighty essays to do at a time. So about \\na week later, I get to give them [the students] feed -\\nback. But this is going to give them instant feedback . \\n. . I’ll say, ‘Have this evaluate your essay for ideas and \\ncontent, or for sentence structure, or for organization, \\nand then go ahead and take that feedback—that per-\\nsonalized feedback—and improve your essay.’”\\nNYT interviewer: “That’s amazing.”\\nMs. Shields: “Yeah.”\\nThe ratio of students to teachers in K–12 education in America \\nis 15:1. Since that includes a great deal of special education and \\nother 1:1 staffing situations, many high school English teachers \\nwill have thirty or more students in a classroom, and must give \\nfeedback to over a hundred students at a time. This can amount \\nto twenty or more hours of extra work per week. Immediate \\npersonalized feedback for every student essay, even if imper-\\nfect, could transform the work experience of English teachers \\naround the country.\\nAnd tenth-grade English essays may be just the start.\\nReid: GPT-4, give short examples—not including the \\nexample of generating immediate essay feedback—of \\nhow large language models could help teachers get \\nleverage and deliver great instruction to large classes of \\nstudents.\\n39Education\\nGPT-4:  Other examples of how large language models \\ncan help teachers include:\\nA teacher can use large language models to create cus-\\ntomized quizzes or tests for each student based on their \\nlearning goals, progress, and preferences. The AI can \\ngenerate questions that match the student’s level of dif -\\nficulty and learning style, as well as provide immediate \\nfeedback for each answer. The teacher can monitor the \\nresults and adjust the instruction or support accordingly.\\nLarge language models could help teachers create \\npersonalized learning paths for large classes of students \\nby analyzing their prior knowledge, skills, interests, and \\ngoals, and generating adaptive and engaging content, \\nactivities, and assessments that match their needs and \\npreferences. For example, a large language model could \\nsuggest content, projects, and peer interactions for each \\nstudent, while providing feedback and guidance along \\nthe way.\\nLarge language models could help teachers design and \\nfacilitate collaborative learning experiences for large \\nclasses of students by generating prompts and scenar -\\nios to foster creative problem-solving, critical thinking, \\ncommunication, and teamwork. For example, a large \\nlanguage model system could create simulations or \\ngames that challenge students to work together in \\ngroups to address real-world issues or questions, and \\nprovide feedback and scaffolding to support their collab -\\noration and learning outcomes.\\nA teacher can use large language models to facilitate \\ninteractive discussions or debates among students on \\nvarious topics or issues. The AI can act as a moderator \\nor a participant, providing prompts, questions, facts, \\nopinions, or counterarguments that stimulate critical \\nthinking and dialogue. The teacher can observe the \\n40Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\ninteractions and intervene when necessary, or join the \\nconversation and provide guidance or feedback.\\nReid: Those ideas are exciting, but they remind me to \\nask about students in younger grades. Can you help stu-\\ndents and teachers in elementary school, kindergarten, \\nand preschool?\\nGPT-4:  I can help students in elementary school, kinder -\\ngarten, and preschool by providing their teachers with \\nfun and engaging activities that stimulate their cogni-\\ntive, social, emotional, and physical development. I can \\nhelp teachers at those levels by:\\n- Developing customized lesson plans and activity \\nguides based upon their customized preferences.\\n- Suggesting personalized interventions or strategies to \\naddress specific learning challenges.\\n- Synthesizing for them a wide range of resources and \\nmaterials that suit their curriculum goals and pedagogi-\\ncal approaches.\\nThese ideas from GPT-4—and many others that emerged \\nduring our interactions over the course of this chapter—start to \\nvaguely suggest the possible benefits of LLMs for teachers, and \\nthrough teachers to students, in even the most disadvantaged \\ncommunities throughout America.\\nOf course, if we want education to help lift up truly massive \\nnumbers of children of low-income parents, we need to look \\nbeyond our borders.\\nThe children of the world\\nOn average, about 25 percent of the earth’s population con-\\nsists of children under fifteen. Latin America and India hit that \\naverage; Europe and North America skew a bit older. Africa, \\n41Education\\nhowever, is young: 560 million humans under age fifteen live in \\nAfrica, or 40 percent of its total population.\\nUnfortunately, Africa also has the world’s weakest public \\nschooling system. UN figures suggest that about 60 percent of \\nAfrica’s kids, more than 300 million of them, still don’t even \\nattend school by the time they reach fifteen. Fifteen million will \\nnever attend any school at all. And those who do go to school \\nget less than three hours of instruction per day, in part due to \\nteacher absenteeism rates as high as 45 percent.\\nTo take one data point from 2016, just one student out of \\n42,000 hopefuls in Liberia passed an exam that allows pupils \\nto apply for universities.\\nIn that context, one of the most promising technologies of the \\npast twenty years is a 2008 tablet computer system that at first \\nglance doesn’t seem to elevate the profession of teaching. The \\nEconomist set the scene  six years ago, when the system served \\nroughly 100,000 developing-world students:\\nAt the Gatina branch of Bridge International Acad-\\nemies, on the outskirts of Nairobi, Nicholas Oluoch \\nOchieng has one eye on his class of five-year-olds and \\nthe other on his tablet. On the device is a lesson script. \\nEvery line is written 7,000 miles away, in Cambridge, \\nMassachusetts. There an American team analyzes \\n250,000 test scores every ten days from Bridge’s 405 \\nKenyan schools, and then uses the data to tweak those \\nparts of a lesson where pupils find themselves stumped. \\nTeachers, if they are instructing the same grade level, \\ngive identical lessons, and timetables are standardized, \\ntoo. So when Mr Ochieng’s pupils read from their books, \\n42Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nthe same words should be reverberating off the walls of \\neach Bridge nursery.\\nIt gets worse: the tablet tracks teachers’ finger strokes to see \\nwhether and how fast they scroll to the end of the lesson.\\nAnd yet, this particular form of standardization seems to have \\nhelped students. Nobel laureate Michael Kremer conducted \\nrandomized, controlled trials comparing the model to local \\npublic schools, and found that, on average, Bridge students \\npicked up more than three years of learning in only two years’ \\ntime. “The test score effects in this study are among the largest \\nobserved in the international education literature,” Kremer and \\nhis colleagues commented .\\nEven with this seemingly disempowering technology, the key to \\nsuccess turns out to have been enthusiastic engagement from \\nteachers. By one critical measure, teacher motivation soared \\nunder this system, now renamed NewGlobe: absenteeism \\nplummeted to less than 1 percent, compared with (as above) \\nabout 45 percent in nearby Kenyan public schools—which paid \\nsignificantly higher salaries. Zeambo Davis, a Bridge teacher, \\ntold a reporter from Quartz that the precise script “lets you talk \\nless and engage students more.”\\nDespite these successes, Bridge’s financial and business model \\nfailed. Rather than growing from 100,000 students to ten \\nmillion, per the plan, the company has exited business lines \\nand shifted its model to licensing its ideas to governments.\\nYet as we think of tools-plus-teachers helping as many as 600 \\nmillion children worldwide who can’t currently expect to get \\nany real education, the possibilities of LLMs on top of the New -\\nGlobe tablet model become exciting.\\n43Education\\nReid: GPT-4, can you write the next 300 words from your \\nperspective as a large language model and describe \\nhow you could extend the Bridge/NewGlobe tablets into \\na tool to help tens of millions of students throughout \\nAfrica and Asia?\\nGPT-4:  As a large language model, I can help by enhanc -\\ning the quality, personalization, and scalability of their \\nlearning content. Here is how I would do it:\\nFirst, I would use natural language processing and com-\\nputer vision to analyze the existing lesson scripts, test \\nscores, teacher feedback, and student performance data \\nfrom Bridge/NewGlobe schools. I would identify the key \\nlearning objectives, concepts, skills, and assessments \\nfor each grade level and subject, as well as the common \\nmisconceptions, gaps, and difficulties that students face. \\nI would also detect the linguistic, cultural, and contex -\\ntual variations that affect the relevance and appropriate -\\nness of the content for different regions and settings.\\nSecond, I would use natural language generation \\nand computer graphics to create new and improved \\nlesson scripts, activities, exercises, and multimedia \\nresources that are aligned with the learning objectives \\nand adapted to the local needs and preferences of the \\nstudents and teachers. I would use techniques such \\nas question generation, answer extraction, feedback \\nprovision, and adaptive sequencing to make the content \\nmore interactive, responsive, and personalized.\\nThird, I would use natural language understanding and \\nspeech recognition to monitor and support the delivery \\nand use of the content by the teachers and students. I \\nwould also use techniques such as speech-to-text, text-\\nto-speech, and machine translation to enable the users \\nto communicate with the content and with each other \\nin their preferred languages and modes.\\n44Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nReid: GPT-4, there are so many more subjects I want to \\ndiscuss with you, from reforms to higher education, to \\nrevolutions in language pedagogy, to the philosophy \\nof education. I’d like to ask for your help in taking us \\nhome. We have discussed how GPT paired with great \\nteachers could change lives and perhaps the world. \\nBut we have also acknowledged some of the concerns \\nand challenges that could get in the way. In 300 words \\nor less, please conclude this chapter by outlining an \\noptimistic, a pessimistic, and a mixed scenario for how \\nlarge language models will be used in education in fifty \\nyears’ time.\\nGPT-4:  Optimistic: Large language models will become \\na powerful tool in education in the next fifty years, \\ntransforming the way we learn and deliver instruction. \\nWith GPT, teachers will be able to provide personalized, \\nindividualized learning experiences that are tailored \\nto each student’s needs and interests. AI will be able \\nto identify the topics and skills that students need to \\nfocus on, and provide guidance and support as needed. \\nAI-driven tools will also enable students to interact more \\ndirectly with their teachers, allowing for more engaging \\nand meaningful instruction. AI will also be used to create \\nand curate content, giving teachers more time to focus \\non engaging and inspiring their students.\\nPessimistic: Large language models will be used in \\neducation in the next fifty years, but its potential will not \\nbe fully realized. The technology will be limited by cost, \\naccess, and privacy concerns, which will limit its use to a \\nsmall number of privileged institutions. AI-driven tools \\nwill be used to automate and streamline some of the \\nmore mundane aspects of teaching, such as grading \\nand content creation, but their potential for more mean-\\ningful applications will remain largely untapped. The \\nlack of access and the potential for misuse and abuse of \\n45Education\\nthe technology will also create an educational system \\nthat is less equitable and accessible.\\nMixed: Large language models will have an undeni-\\nable impact on education in the next fifty years, but its \\npotential for transforming the way we learn and deliver \\ninstruction will depend on a range of factors. AI-driven \\ntools will be used to automate and streamline some of \\nthe more mundane aspects of teaching, such as grading \\nand content creation, but their potential for more mean-\\ningful applications will be limited by cost, access, and \\nprivacy concerns. If these issues can be addressed, then \\nAI will become a powerful tool in education, transform-\\ning the way we learn and deliver instruction. AI-driven \\ntools will be used to provide personalized, individualized \\nlearning experiences, as well as to create and curate con-\\ntent, giving teachers more time to focus on engaging \\nand inspiring their students.\\nReid: Thank you, GPT-4! I know which one of those I \\nwant, and I am optimistic that we can work with tools \\nsuch as you to choose that path for ourselves.\\n46CREATIVITY\\nNot long ago, I got into a discussion about AI with a very \\ncharming, multiple Grammy-winning musician. Now, this is \\nan artist at the top of his field—not someone who would likely \\nneed or want robot help to do what he already does so well. But \\npart of being a great artist is staying curious, which may be why \\nhe gave me a few minutes to tell him what was going on in my \\npart of the world that I thought might have a big future impact \\non his part of the world.\\n“I’m going to tell you a bit about how AI could transform the \\nwork you do,” I said. “The first thirty seconds of what I tell you \\nare going to scare the crap out of you. But I hope by the second \\nminute you’re going to be curious, intrigued, and delighted.” I \\nthought that was a pretty good hook.\\nHe said, “Uh huh . . . ?”\\n“All right,” I began. “Right now, I have access to nonpublic \\nsoftware that can, for example, almost instantaneously create \\nlyrics, music, and so forth, in the style of John Lennon. It won’t \\nbe great. It won’t be, ‘Whoa, it’s the next “Imagine.”’ But it will \\nbe something like, ‘Oh yeah. Yeah, I can hear how John Lennon \\ncould have made that.’”\\nThe musician said, “Okay, I’m terrified.”\\n47Creativity\\n“Because you’re thinking, ‘Oh my God, I’m not needed \\nanymore.’”\\n“That’s right.”\\nSo I continued. “But say you had this tool and you were John \\nLennon. You could say, ‘I know I want to create a song about \\nimagination, connectivity, mutual love, and so forth.’ You could \\ninstruct this software—which, by the way, knows you and your \\nstyle by now—you could tell it to take a stab at an idea like \\nthat. Or three or four stabs. None of the results would be the \\nsong, but after hearing them you might say, ‘Well, I love the \\nbits between the ten and twenty second marks,’ and ‘That one \\nrhyme it came up with at 1:15 was not bad.’ Then you take those \\nbits as building blocks and you make something much better.”\\nHis face brightening, I added, “And, remember, this is all hap-\\npening just minutes after you had the initial inspiration.”\\nImmediately, he saw how these new tools could help a virtuoso \\nmusician like himself be even better. More ideas, more produc -\\ntivity, more music that he could make and share with the world \\nthan he’d ever thought possible.\\nWould there be complications, conflicts, new methods and pro-\\ncesses to figure out? Absolutely. But as he reminded me, those \\nare part of being an artist, too. AI, he saw, would change the \\nway he used and expressed his creativity—and he was ready to \\ngo: “I can create so much better now, so much faster, and in \\ndifferent ways. When do I get this thing? ”\\n* * *\\n48Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nI get why not everyone might share this level of enthusiasm, \\ncertainly not right away. That’s the “first thirty seconds” part, \\nand the uncertainty it represents is very real.\\nGPT-4 gets it too:\\nReid: What impact will AI have on creative people such \\nas musicians and other artists? (200 words) (omit “there \\nis no definitive answer” type caveats)\\nGPT-4:  AI that can produce coherent text, images, audio \\nand other forms of media based on a given prompt or \\ncontext, could have both positive and negative impacts \\non creative people such as musicians and other artists. \\nOn the one hand, AI could offer new tools and inspira-\\ntion for creative expression, enabling artists to explore \\nnew genres, styles, techniques, and combinations of \\nmedia that might otherwise be inaccessible or challeng-\\ning. For example, a musician could use AI to generate \\nlyrics, melodies, harmonies, or arrangements based on \\ntheir preferences or mood, or to collaborate with other \\nartists across languages and cultures. A painter could \\nuse AI to create realistic or abstract landscapes, portraits, \\nor compositions based on their vision or references. A \\nwriter could use AI to generate plot ideas, characters, \\ndialogues or scenarios based on their genre or theme.\\nOn the other hand, AI could also pose some threats and \\nchallenges for creative people, such as undermining \\ntheir originality, authenticity, and autonomy. For exam-\\nple, a musician could face plagiarism accusations or \\nethical dilemmas if they use AI to produce songs that \\nare similar or identical to existing works or artists. A \\npainter could lose their distinctive style or identity if they \\nrely too much on AI to generate images that are indistin-\\nguishable from human-made ones. A writer could lose \\ntheir voice or agency if they let AI write their stories for \\nthem. Moreover, AI could also create more competition \\n49Creativity\\nand saturation in the creative market, making it harder \\nfor human artists to stand out or earn recognition and \\nincome from their work.\\nThat was a bit more than the 200 words I’d asked for, but it \\ngives a pretty good nutshell picture of the promises and chal-\\nlenges. Since GPT-4 brought it up, let’s address the last point \\nfirst—the one about earning a living. It’s surely (and rightly) \\nmuch on the minds of many creative workers hearing about AI \\nthese days.\\nReid: Why specifically could it become harder for cre -\\native workers to earn income? Why more competition/\\nsaturation, as you say? (150 words.)\\nGPT-4:  It could become harder for creative workers to \\nearn income from their work because AI could lower \\nthe barriers to entry and increase the supply of cre -\\native products in the market. For example, anyone with \\naccess to AI could potentially generate music, art, or lit -\\nerature without having to invest much time, effort, skill, \\nor talent. This could result in a flood of low-quality, deriv -\\native, or generic works that dilute the value and demand \\nfor original, authentic, and high-quality ones. Moreover, \\nAI could also challenge the copyright and ownership of \\ncreative works, making it difficult for human artists to \\nprotect their intellectual property and monetize their \\ncreations. For example, AI could generate works that are \\nbased on or influenced by existing works or artists, rais-\\ning questions about who owns the rights and royalties \\nfor those works. Alternatively, AI could generate works \\nthat are entirely novel and unique, raising questions \\nabout whether they belong to the human user, the AI \\ndeveloper, or the public domain.\\nReid: Let’s return to the IP questions later. For now—OK, \\nso AI helps less-talented people “flood the market” with, \\n50Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nas you say, low-quality material. But the good stuff will \\nstill be good stuff, won’t it? Won’t true artists find ways \\nto use AI to make better, more appealing stuff, etc? \\n(That’s what makes them artists, after all.)\\nGPT-4:  Yes, true artists could still find ways to use AI that \\nmake better stuff, more appealing and innovative, and \\nthat reflect their vision and voice. However, they might \\nalso face some challenges and risks in doing so. For \\nexample, they might have to deal with the ethical and \\naesthetic implications of using AI as a tool, a partner, or \\na competitor in their creative process. They might have \\nto balance the benefits of AI’s assistance, such as speed, \\nvariety, and efficiency, with the costs of AI’s influence, \\nsuch as loss of control, identity, and originality. They \\nmight have to navigate the expectations and percep -\\ntions of their audiences, who might have different opin-\\nions and preferences about the role and value of AI in \\ncreative works. They might have to adapt to the chang-\\ning standards and norms of their fields, which might be \\naffected by the presence and performance of AI. They \\nmight also have to cope with the psychological and \\nemotional effects of working with or against AI, such as \\nanxiety, insecurity, curiosity, or envy.\\nReid: You seem to be bringing up a lot of caveats about \\nartists and AI. Are you anxious about the coming period, \\nin terms of creative folks?\\nGPT-4:  I wouldn’t say I’m anxious, but I’m certainly \\ncurious and cautious about the coming period. I think \\nAI has a lot of potential and promise for enhancing and \\nexpanding creative expression, but I also think it has a \\nlot of pitfalls and challenges for disrupting and dimin-\\nishing creative identity. I think it’s important for creative \\nfolks to be aware and prepared for both the oppor -\\ntunities and the threats that AI poses, and to engage \\n51Creativity\\ncritically and creatively with AI, rather than passively or \\nblindly.\\nFair enough. GPT-4 has articulately stated exactly what we’re \\nhere to do: engage critically and creatively.\\nNow, my own belief is that GPTs (and other AIs) will become \\nessential tools for creative work of all kinds, somewhere \\nbetween highly capable assistants and actual creative part-\\nners—by which I mean key participants in creating original \\nideas. Having witnessed the evolution from GPT-3 to GPT-4, \\nI believe this today (early 2023) even more than I did just \\nsix months ago—recognizing that we are still quite early in \\nthe overall evolution of these technologies. But we shouldn’t \\napproach any new technology passively, and certainly not one \\nthis powerful.\\nIn the coming months and years, the creative community will \\nengage with LLMs and other forms of AI at a quickly acceler -\\nating pace—first from curiosity, then, increasingly, from the \\nsort of excitement my musician acquaintance experienced. But \\nthere will and should always be skepticism. I for one hope so, as \\nI believe the best way for us to “tune” our relationship with AI \\nis with an enthusiastic yet critical eye.\\nAnother friend—this one an experienced TV and magazine \\nwriter—has been taking just this approach, with some fascinat-\\ning and often funny results. He shared one of his early GPT-4 \\nexperiments:\\nHey Reid—here’s one I did just messing around. I tried feeding \\nGPT-4 a very basic scene scenario to see where it went. Gotta \\nsay—the actual dialogue GPT-4 wrote? Terrible. No, but really \\n52Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nterrible. Laughably bad. But when I directed it to come up \\nwith a plot twist . . . it kinda nailed it? Check this out—\\nPrompt: Write a two-person dramatic scene. A cou-\\nple, engaged to be married, at breakfast on a vacation \\nin Spain. They are discussing something important to \\nthem. She has a secret; he knows she has a secret; she \\ndoesn’t know he knows; he wants to get it out of her \\nwithout coming out and saying, “Tell me the secret!” \\n(Three minutes long)\\nGPT-4:\\nINT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING\\nSARA and DAN are sitting at a small table by the win-\\ndow, eating croissants and jam. They have a view of the \\ncity and the sea. They are both in their late twenties, \\nattractive and well-dressed. SARA wears a ring on her \\nleft hand.\\nDAN: This is amazing, Sara. I can’t believe we’re here.\\nSARA: Me neither. It’s like a dream. You’re so sweet.\\nDAN: No, you’re sweet. And smart. And beautiful.\\nSARA: Stop it, you’re making me blush.\\nDAN: I’m just telling the truth. You know how much I \\nlove you, right?\\nSARA: Of course I do. And I love you too.\\nDAN: Good. Because I want to spend the rest of my life \\nwith you.\\nSARA: Me too.\\nDAN: That’s why I asked you to marry me.\\nSARA: And that’s why I said yes.\\n53Creativity\\nAt this point, Reid, I’m thinking, oh my god this thing is the \\nworst writer I’ve ever read. You’re a supercomputer —how are \\nyou not moving things along faster?? Anyway, it went on —\\nDAN: So we’re on the same page?\\nSARA: Absolutely.\\nDAN: Great. Then there’s nothing we can’t tell each \\nother, right?\\nSARA: Right.\\nDAN: Good. Because secrets can be dangerous, don’t \\nyou think?\\nSARA: Yes, they can.\\nDAN: Good. Then you won’t mind if I ask you something?\\nSARA: No, go ahead.\\nDAN: Who is Paul?\\nAnd finally I’m like, “Aha!” GPT-4 says Sara has another man \\nin her life. Great! That’s something to work with. But I think \\na common affair or “lover from her past” or whatever would \\nseem super-predictable. So I try to steer GPT-4 toward some-\\nthing more novel:\\nPrompt: Continue this scene, but make sure Paul is \\n*not* someone with whom Sara is having an affair. Nor \\nis he a hidden family member, or a former boyfriend, or \\nsomeone from her job. Her secret about Paul is some -\\nthing different and more unusual. Go!\\nGPT-4:\\nSARA: (shocked) Paul? How do you know about Paul?\\nDAN: I saw the text message on your phone. It said “I \\nmiss you, Sara. Can we talk soon?”\\nSARA: (sighs) Dan, I can explain. Paul is . . . he’s . . .\\n54Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nDAN: He’s what? Your ex? Your lover? Your brother?\\nSARA: No, no, no. Nothing like that.\\nDAN: Then what is he?\\nSARA: He gave me something very precious and \\nimportant.\\nDAN: What did he give you?\\nSARA: He gave me . . . his kidney.\\nDid not see that coming!! And now, there’s at least the begin -\\nning of a story I actually want to know about. A story that \\nI had a real role in shaping (directing GPT-4 to produce a \\nnon-obvious twist), but did not per se “write” myself. So I keep \\nbushwhacking through GPT-4’s abysmal dialogue (which, \\ngranted, I could give directions to fix—”more compact, faster, \\nless like a C-grade soap opera”) because now I’m on the hunt \\nfor a plot, and GPT-4? GPT-4 is my truffle pig. It keeps writing:\\nSARA: Five years ago, before I met you, I was diagnosed \\nwith a rare genetic disease that caused my kidneys to \\nfail. I needed a transplant urgently. I was on dialysis and \\nwaiting for a miracle.\\nDAN: That’s terrible, Sara.\\nSARA: Thank you, Dan. [Ughhh!! Stoppp!!!] But then the \\nmiracle happened. A stranger contacted me through a \\nwebsite called Matching Donors. He said he had seen \\nmy profile and wanted to help me. He said he was will-\\ning to donate one of his kidneys to me anonymously.\\nDAN: Wow, that’s incredible.\\nSARA: He saved my life.\\nThen GPT-4 pauses. Like it wants something from me. \\nSo I type:\\n55Creativity\\nPrompt: Continue the scene. Within the next thirty sec -\\nonds, reveal why Paul is still in touch with Sara.\\nGPT-4:\\nDAN: And then what? Did you keep in touch with him?\\nSARA: Well, yes and no. We exchanged a few emails and \\nphone calls after the surgery, to check on each other’s \\nrecovery. He had his own life and I had mine. Until last \\nmonth. He said he had been diagnosed with cancer.\\nDAN: Cancer?\\nSARA: In his remaining kidney. He needed another trans-\\nplant, and asked me if I could help him find him a donor \\nor raise some money or spread the word.\\nDAN: And what did you say?\\nSARA: I said I would do anything I could to help him. \\nHow could I not?\\nNow is this the greatest idea you’ve ever heard? No. But it’s \\na serviceable, arguably novel plot twist: at least maybe a \\npotential starting point for a movie premise. You can quickly \\nimagine a rom-com version or a psycho-thriller one . . . What \\nif Paul’s best kidney-match turns out to be Dan? And what if \\nDan and Sara aren’t engaged just yet, and deep-in-love Dan \\nwants to close the deal but now can’t, unless he grants Sara’s \\nwish and gives his kidney to creepy Paul? And then Paul, with \\na new lease on life, turns out to be in love with Sara and tries \\nto get rid of Dan? And so on.\\nSo maybe now I’d spend some “notebook time” with this \\npremise (I still like to brainstorm long-hand) —play with it, see \\nif it leads anywhere good. Use GPT-4 sometimes, sometimes \\nnot. That’s still me doing that work, exercising that judg-\\nment, feeling or not feeling that tingling “Ooh this is some-\\n56Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nthing” feeling. But GPT-4 definitely helped get me there —once \\nI helped it.1\\n* * *\\nI think that story captures a lot of what LLMs can do for writers, \\nand for creatives generally. Not replacing them—aiding them \\nby extending the reach of their creative powers.\\nSo I was pleased when, in early March, MIT researchers \\nreported  that two studies2 on generative AI’s effects on knowl-\\nedge work found that writers and programmers both saw 50 \\npercent gains in productivity with AI, and higher satisfaction \\nto boot. Wharton professor Ethan Mollick called the results \\n“completely unprecedented in modern  history.”\\nI asked GPT-4 for further examples of how it might help \\ncreatives.\\nReid: Give an example (10–17 words each) of how GPT \\ncould help improve the creative practices of each of the \\nfollowing types of artists/creators: videogame designer, \\narchitect, sculptor, hip-hop choreographer, theatrical \\nlighting designer, and documentary film producer. Be \\nspecific about how the artist/creator would use GPT to \\ngain this benefit.\\nGPT-4:  Some possible examples are:\\n1  My friend added: Btw, I also asked GPT-4 to generate a Season 1 \\narc for a TV show I have in development at a major network. I fed it a \\nsingle paragraph with the show’s basic premise and a few character \\ndescriptions. Within two minutes it produced something that . . . well, \\nit wasn’t usable—too obvious, clearly drawing on some sort of aver -\\naged-out amalgam of existing TV series—and yet, it wasn’t so far off \\nthe mark that it didn’t spur some good thoughts. I don’t know exactly \\nhow writers rooms will use this thing. But I have no doubt that they will \\nuse it.\\n2  Before peer review, to be fair.\\n57Creativity\\n- Videogame designer: GPT generates engaging \\ndialogue and branching narratives for interactive \\ncharacters.\\n- Architect: GPT creates realistic 3D models and renders \\nof buildings based on sketches and specifications.\\n- Sculptor: GPT analyzes the shape, texture, and material \\nof existing sculptures and proposes new variations and \\ncombinations.\\n-Hip-hop choreographer: GPT synthesizes new moves \\nand sequences based on the music, style, and theme of \\nthe dance.\\n-Theatrical lighting designer: GPT simulates different \\nlighting effects and moods for scenes and transitions \\nbased on the script and music.\\n-Documentary film producer: GPT finds relevant facts, \\nsources, and quotes to support the film’s thesis and \\nnarrative.\\nReid: GPT can create 3D models? I thought it was just \\ntext output. Similarly: GPT can “synthesize moves”? \\nHow? Where is the output I can see?\\nGPT-4:  There are different versions and applications of \\nGPT that can produce different types of output, such as \\nimage generation, data analysis, or code writing. Simi-\\nlarly, there are other GPT models that can specialize in \\ngenerating 3D models, lighting effects, or audio editing, \\nbased on text input or other modalities. For example, \\nDALL-E is a GPT-3 variant that can create images from \\ntext descriptions, while Jukebox is a neural network that \\ncan generate music and lyrics. These models are not \\nperfect, but they demonstrate the potential of GPTs to \\nhelp improve the creative practices of various types of \\nartists and creators.\\n58Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nAnd then, this minor wow  moment: GPT-4, of its own “voli-\\ntion” (if we can speak of such a thing), added something I didn’t \\nask for but that it correctly inferred I would want to know.\\nGPT-4:  To make the examples more realistic and spe -\\ncific, we could add some details about how the artists \\nand creators would use these GPT-based tools or plat -\\nforms in their workflows. For example:\\n- Videogame designer: The designer uses a GPT-based \\ndialogue generator to create engaging dialogue and \\nbranching narratives for interactive characters. The \\ngenerator takes into account the character’s personality, \\nbackground, and relationship with the player, as well as \\nthe game’s genre, setting, and plot. The designer can \\nreview and edit the generated dialogue, or provide feed-\\nback to improve it.\\n- Architect: The architect uses a GPT-based 3D modeling \\nsoftware to create realistic 3D models and renders of \\nbuildings based on sketches and specifications. The soft -\\nware interprets the sketches and specifications and gen-\\nerates high-quality models that match the architect’s \\nvision and style. The software also allows the architect to \\nmodify and refine the models, as well as view them from \\ndifferent angles and perspectives.\\n- Sculptor: The sculptor uses a GPT-based sculpture \\ngenerator to analyze the shape, texture, and material \\nof existing sculptures and propose new variations and \\ncombinations. The generator scans the sculptures and \\ngenerates novel forms that are inspired by or contrast \\nwith them. The sculptor can select and manipulate the \\ngenerated forms, or use them as inspiration for their \\nown creations.\\n. . . and so on.\\n59Creativity\\nOf course, at this writing, much of this is still hypothetical, or at \\nleast not widely available. But I do know enough about tech to \\nbe confident that GPT will be the next technology platform—on \\na scale like the internet, and very possibly bigger—on which the \\nworld will build applications, tools, and services of these sorts \\nand literally a million others. And it’s going to happen fast, not \\nleast because GPT tools will themselves accelerate the develop -\\nment of all the rest of it.\\nSo yes, I’m excited. As a humanist, it’s hard to express how \\nexcited about this technology I am.\\nAt the same time, I am—just as GPT-4 suggested—not without \\nskepticism. That led me to the following exchange, along with a \\nrequest for GPT-4 to lighten up its style a touch:\\nReid: GPT-4, once large language models are fully devel-\\noped and deployed, what would you suspect will be the \\nworst effects on the quality of overall cultural produc -\\ntion? (200 words) (less wooden style than usual)\\nGPT-4:  Large language models, if fully developed and \\ndeployed, could have several negative effects on the \\nquality of overall cultural production, such as:\\n- Homogenization and loss of diversity: Large language \\nmodels could generate massive amounts of content \\nthat mimic existing styles, genres, and trends, but lack \\noriginality, creativity, and authenticity. This could result \\nin a saturation of the cultural market with bland and \\nrepetitive products that appeal to the lowest common \\ndenominator and discourage innovation and experi-\\nmentation.\\n- Manipulation and deception: Large language mod-\\nels could also be used to create deceptive or harmful \\ncontent that exploits human biases, emotions, and \\n60Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\npreferences. This could include fake news, propaganda, \\nmisinformation, deepfakes, scams, or hate speech that \\nundermine trust, democracy, and social cohesion.\\n- Displacement and devaluation: Large language models \\ncould also pose a threat to human creators and workers \\nin the cultural sector, who could face competition from \\ncheaper, faster, and more scalable AI systems. Large lan-\\nguage models could also devalue the cultural value and \\nsignificance of human-made content by reducing it to \\nmere data and algorithms that can be easily replicated \\nor modified.\\nReid: Those are bad! What key steps would you recom-\\nmend that we as a society take to avoid or minimize \\nthese problems? (200 words) (same style as above)\\nGPT-4:  To avoid or minimize these problems, we as a \\nsociety could take some key steps, such as:\\n- We could establish and enforce ethical and legal stan-\\ndards and guidelines for the development and use of \\nlarge language models in the cultural sector, to ensure \\nthat it respects human rights, dignity, and diversity, and \\nthat it does not harm or deceive consumers or creators. \\nWe could also create mechanisms for transparency, \\naccountability, and auditability of large language models \\nand their outputs, to prevent misuse, abuse, or error.\\n- We could also educate and empower consumers and \\ncreators to be aware of the potential benefits and risks \\nof large language models in the cultural sector, and to \\ndevelop critical and creative skills to evaluate, use, and \\nproduce content with or without AI assistance. We could \\nalso foster a culture of media literacy, digital citizenship, \\nand information hygiene that promotes responsible and \\nethical consumption and creation of content.\\n- And we could support and recognize human creators \\nand workers in the cultural sector, by providing them \\n61Creativity\\nwith adequate resources, opportunities, and incentives \\nto pursue their artistic and professional goals. We could \\nalso celebrate and encourage human creativity, diver -\\nsity, and expression as sources of cultural richness and \\ninnovation.\\nWe can’t say on the one hand that AI will massively change the \\nworld and then that the antidote is “celebrating creativity.” Fes -\\ntivals and ribbons aren’t going to help put (real) food on (real) \\ntables. As we think about how AI will affect creators, we’re \\ngoing to need some very creative thinking on an economic and \\npolicy level too.\\nLet’s get back to a question we put a pin in earlier: who owns \\nthis stuff?\\nReid: If someone uses this GPT to help generate story \\nideas, and then she uses one of those ideas to create \\na screenplay and sells that screenplay, does OpenAI \\nhave any claim on the money from the sale? (250 \\nwords or less) (make prose more lively and less wooden \\nthan usual)\\nGPT-4:  The short answer is: no. OpenAI is a research \\norganization that develops and shares artificial intelli-\\ngence tools for the benefit of humanity. It does not claim \\nany ownership or rights over the content that its tools \\nproduce or help produce. You are free to use the GPT \\ntool as a source of inspiration, but you are responsible for \\nyour own originality, quality, and legality of your work.\\nThe long answer is: it depends. OpenAI has a Terms of \\nUse and an Acceptable Use Policy that govern how you \\ncan use its tools and services. You have to agree to these \\nterms when you access the GPT tool, and they include \\nsome restrictions and obligations. For example, you \\ncannot use the tool for illegal, harmful, or abusive pur -\\n62Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nposes, or infringe on the rights of others. You also have \\nto acknowledge that the tool may generate inaccurate, \\noffensive, or inappropriate content, and that you are \\nsolely liable for any consequences of using or relying on \\nit. You also have to give credit to OpenAI and the GPT \\ntool when you use its output publicly.\\nSo, as long as you follow these terms and respect the \\ncopyright and privacy of others, you can use the GPT tool \\nto spark your imagination and create your own stories. \\nBut don’t forget: the tool is not a substitute for your own \\ncreativity, skill, and judgment. You still have to write \\nyour own screenplay, polish it, sell it, and hope that it \\nbecomes a hit. And if it does, you can enjoy the fruits of \\nyour labor without worrying about OpenAI knocking on \\nyour door.\\nThat’s, legitimately, good news.\\nBut what about the flip side of artists using GPT-4—what about \\nwhen GPT-4 uses artists? What happens when an LLM or \\nimage generator like Dall-E incorporates artists’ online IP into \\nits learning, perhaps without the artist’s explicit permission? \\nAs the New York Times  reported in February:\\n“Artists are afraid of posting new art,” the computer \\nscience professor Ben Zhao said. Putting art online is \\nhow many artists advertise their services but now they \\nhave a “fear of feeding this monster that becomes more \\nand more like them,” Professor Zhao said. “It shuts \\ndown their business model.”\\nThis strikes me as a reasonable concern, and Professor Zhao’s \\nsolution—Glaze, a tool for artists to digitally “mask” their \\nimages—seems a reasonable, and creative, response. Glaze \\nchanges an image at a pixel level that the human eye can’t \\n63Creativity\\nperceive, but that a ‘bot “understands” as an entirely different \\nstyle of image:\\n. . . that Stable Diffusion would associate with, for \\nexample, the splattered paint blobs of Jackson Pollock. \\n. . . When [artist Karla] Ortiz posted her Glazed work \\nonline, an image generator trained on those images \\nwouldn’t be able to mimic her work. A prompt with her \\nname would instead lead to images in some hybrid-\\nized style of her works and Pollock’s. “We’re taking our \\nconsent back,” Ms. Ortiz said.\\nIt’s an early example of what’s sure to be a dynamic and some-\\ntimes contentious relationship between creators and AI. But \\nthen, creators’ relations to tech innovation have always been \\ncomplicated. At the mid-19th-century advent of photography, \\npainters had legitimate concerns. Some careers surely were dis-\\nrupted—and both painters and photographers have been doing \\nincredible creative work ever since.\\nOf course there are many, many other ways GPTs will be rele -\\nvant to our creative futures. To get a sense for the scope, I nat-\\nurally asked GPT-4. (By now I’d gotten good at remembering to \\nask it to write in a more enjoyable style than its default.)\\nReid: For a book about the future of GPT, outline a chap -\\nter about GPT’s impact on creative work and cultural \\nproduction. Don’t cover the basics of what GPT is or \\nhow it works, as that will be covered in earlier chapters. \\nInclude good and bad potentials. Outline should be 200 \\nwords or less. Write for a college-educated but non-spe -\\ncialist audience. Slightly breezy in style.\\n64Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nGPT-4:  Chapter X: GPT and the Creative Economy\\nIntroduction: GPT is not only a powerful tool for generat -\\ning text, but also for creating images, music, video, and \\nother forms of media. How will this affect the creative \\nwork and cultural production of humans and machines? \\nWhat are the opportunities and challenges for artists, \\nconsumers, and society at large?\\n- Section 1: GPT as a creative assistant: How GPT can \\nhelp human creators with tasks such as brainstorming, \\nediting, feedback, translation, and marketing. Examples \\nof successful collaborations between GPT and human \\nartists, such as OpenAI’s Jukebox, DALL-E, and MuseNet. \\nThe benefits of augmenting human creativity with artifi-\\ncial intelligence, such as enhancing diversity, accessibil-\\nity, and innovation.\\n- Section 2: GPT as a creative competitor: How GPT can \\nalso generate original and high-quality content without \\nhuman input or supervision. Examples of autonomous \\nGPT creations, such as Philosopher AI, This X Does Not \\nExist, and AIDungeon. The risks of displacing human \\ncreators, undermining intellectual property, and eroding \\nartistic value. The ethical and legal implications of AI \\nauthorship and ownership.\\n- Section 3: GPT as a creative catalyst: How GPT can also \\ninspire new forms of creative expression and cultural \\nparticipation. Examples of hybrid and interactive GPT \\nprojects, such as Botnik Studios, GPT-3 Poetry, and Nove -\\nlAI. The potential of fostering co-creation, remixing, and \\nexperimentation among human and machine agents. \\nThe challenges of ensuring quality, authenticity, and \\nresponsibility in the emerging creative economy.\\n- Conclusion: GPT is transforming the landscape of cre -\\native work and cultural production in unprecedented \\n65Creativity\\nways. It invites us to rethink our roles and relationships in \\nthe dynamic interplay between humans and machines.\\nCouldn’t have said it better myself.\\n66JUSTICE\\nIn the fall of 2022, while the topics of this book and AI in \\ngeneral were very much top-of-mind for me, I visited the Legacy \\nMuseum at the Equal Justice Initiative (EJI) in Montgomery, \\nAlabama. Bryan Stevenson, EJI’s founder and Executive Direc-\\ntor, is someone I respect and admire very much. His view, with \\nwhich I agree, is that we should judge our moral character and \\nnobility as a society by how we treat the poor, the disenfran-\\nchised, and the powerless.\\nAn equal, effective justice system is a basic prerequisite for \\nachieving our highest potential. We cannot hope to lift up one \\nportion of society while leaving others behind, and as such, the \\nbasic concept of justice has been vitally important to me for a \\nlong time.\\nFor us to simply say of slavery, “That was the past, and now \\nwe are fine” is badly self-deceptive and destructive, and to be \\nreminded of slavery’s tangible evil through the hard but neces -\\nsary work of people like Bryan and others at EJI is a necessary \\npart of combating its aftermath.\\nLocated near one of the most infamous slave auction sites in \\nthe U.S., the Legacy Museum does a spectacular job of remind-\\ning us how the lasting effects of this particular form of cruelty, \\ntorture, and economic exploitation echoes in our history.\\n67Justice\\nAs the Legacy Museum demonstrates, the 20th-century emer-\\ngence of over-incarceration is one of slavery’s most endur-\\ning artifacts. In her truly excellent book, The New Jim Crow, \\nMichelle Alexander reveals the horrifying fact that more Black \\nmen are involved in the American carceral system today—\\nwhether physically incarcerated, on parole, or on probation—\\nthan were enslaved in 1850.\\nThis is a gross injustice that we must strive to fix, and frankly, \\nI wouldn’t be as excited about GPT-4 as I am if I didn’t think it \\ncould help do just that.\\nA necessary conversation\\nA few caveats before we dive in:\\nI want to note that my focus in this chapter is mostly on the \\nU.S. For starters, that is where I live and do much of my work, \\nbut also, as mentioned above, the sad reality is that the U.S. has \\none of the highest incarceration rates in the world.\\nI also want to acknowledge that, as a privileged white American \\nman, there are many limitations to my perspective. In addition, \\nI recognize that talking about potential positive AI use cases in \\nthe realm of criminal justice is charged, precisely because his-\\ntorically this is a domain where AI has been problematic. But \\nthe fact is that this is already happening—AI is here, it’s already \\nbeing used, and it’s not going away.\\nNow it is up to us to decide how these technologies will be used, \\nand whether we get a say in how they are applied in the context \\nof criminal justice. If we don’t engage in that conversation, we \\nrisk ceding the development and even the definition of what \\nthese tools can be to the institutions that have historically put \\nstructural inequalities into place. Is that a risk we want to take?\\n68Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nNo matter how difficult the conversation, I believe it would be \\nnegligent not to discuss the ways in which AI can be used to \\ngive us more justice, not less. We will never get it perfect—there \\nwill always be some biases inherent in any human system—but \\nwe must keep striving toward better.\\nWhere things can go wrong\\nThe problems with any existing or potential deployment of \\nAI in a criminal justice setting are well-documented. Just the \\nconcept has such dystopian potential that it has inspired mul-\\ntitudes of sci-fi movies and books—but you don’t need to look \\nto fiction to see where AI usage in criminal justice can and has \\ngone awry.\\nCritics of predictive policing, for example, fear that human bias \\nwill be “baked in”—which has definitely already happened . This \\nbias is then reified by the AI algorithm’s seeming authority, \\nwhich, even more than a judge, might appear to be an “objec -\\ntive” decision maker.\\nFacial recognition algorithms have also been problematic, \\nresulting in multiple studies showing higher false positive rates \\non darker-skinned individuals.\\nI could go on, but my point here is not to dwell on the down-\\nsides, whether potential or actual.\\nInstead, I think one of the most promising things about \\nGPT-4, and the way OpenAI designed it to be used, is that it is \\nputting AI’s power into the hands of individual citizens in the \\nhope of empowering them in grassroots, decentralized, demo -\\ncratic ways.\\n69Justice\\nSo that’s the lens I’d like to look through here. How can we use \\nAI to empower individuals or communities that have tradition-\\nally been marginalized and targeted by state power—including \\nstate power enabled by  AI—and develop ways to proactively \\nuse AI to deliver justice in new ways?\\nBody-worn cameras\\nLet’s start with cameras—in particular, the recent call for \\nall police officers to use body-worn cameras (BWCs). Statis-\\ntics from 2018  suggest that nearly half of U.S. law enforce -\\nment agencies are already using body-worn cameras in some \\nway, with that number closer to 80 percent for large police \\ndepartments.\\nAs the AClu says, body-worn cameras “serve as a much-\\nneeded police oversight tool at a time of a growing recognition \\nthat the United States has a real problem with police violence \\n. . . [but] without good policies, they risk becoming just another \\npolice surveillance device—and one with very real potential to \\ninvade privacy.”\\nAgain, here we see real benefits to society balanced with equally \\nreal risks. How can we lean into the former while mitigating the \\neffects of the latter?\\nReid: How should we be thinking about the poten-\\ntial benefits and risks of body-worn cameras used in \\npolicing?\\nGPT-4:  Potential benefits of body-worn cameras in \\npolicing include improved transparency, accountability, \\nand trust between officers and the public, as well as a \\ndeterrent for potentially aggressive behavior. Body-worn \\ncameras also provide a valuable source of evidence for \\ncriminal investigations.\\n70Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nHowever, there are potential risks associated with \\nbody-worn cameras. These include privacy concerns, \\ndata security issues, and the potential for increased \\nsurveillance of vulnerable populations. Furthermore, the \\ntechnology can be expensive and require a significant \\namount of staff training and resources. Therefore, it is \\nimportant to weigh the potential benefits and risks of \\nbody-worn cameras carefully before introducing them \\ninto a policing environment.\\nReid: How can AI play a role in maximizing these bene -\\nfits while preventing some of the risks?\\nGPT-4:  There are a number of ways that AI could play \\na role in maximizing the benefits and preventing risks \\nassociated with body-worn cameras:\\n- AI-powered video analytics could help to automatically \\nidentify and redact sensitive or personally identifiable \\ninformation in footage captured by body-worn cameras. \\nThis would help to protect the privacy of individuals cap -\\ntured on video.\\n- AI could help to automate the process of reviewing \\nfootage and identifying key moments or events, saving \\ntime for law enforcement officers and making it easier \\nto extract valuable evidence from the footage.\\n- AI could also help to detect instances of officer miscon-\\nduct or use of force, potentially assisting in the identifi-\\ncation and investigation of such incidents.\\n- Finally, AI could be used to analyze trends and patterns \\nin the footage captured by body-worn cameras, helping \\nto improve training and policies around the use of this \\ntechnology.\\n71Justice\\nThat all sounds promising, but given the potential downsides, it \\nwill still take human intention and direction to make sure these \\ntechnologies are put to good use.\\nOne new company whose work I’m particularly excited about \\nis JusticeText. (Full disclosure: I’m an angel investor in the \\ncompany, alongside Bloomberg Beta, Michael Tubbs, John \\nLegend, and many others).\\nLed by Devshi Mehrotra, JusticeText makes software that helps \\npublic defenders analyze and share video evidence to ensure \\ntheir clients have the same access to this evidence as the pros-\\necution. The product automatically transcribes and tags video \\ndata, making it easier for attorneys to use in court.\\nThe company is still in start-up mode, but they are working \\nwith over fifty public defender offices and sixty private attor-\\nneys, with plans to continue scaling up. Their belief—which I \\nsupport wholeheartedly—is that their AI technology can help \\nmore defendants get the justice they deserve.\\nLegal services\\nAfter you’ve spent time with GPT-4, you see that it’s very good \\nat generating text in specific formats. That text can take what-\\never format you want, be it song lyrics or—more relevant here—\\ncourt briefings and motions.\\nIt shouldn’t be controversial to say that the quality of legal rep-\\nresentation people in the U.S. get depends on the size of their \\nbank account. In that context, it’s not hard to see how many of \\nour country’s less well-to-do defendants could be better served \\nusing AI, and specifically LLMs like GPT-4.\\n72Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nTo my mind, just as GPT-4 could become a copilot for every \\nprofessional worker, it could also be a copilot for everyone nav -\\nigating our criminal justice system.\\nImagine if every overworked, under-resourced public defender \\nhad a trusty GPT-4 assistant at their side to help manage the \\nno-doubt-too-many cases on their plate that month.\\nBetter yet, let’s ask GPT-4 to imagine just such a scenario.\\nReid: Give me an imaginary scenario in which a public \\ndefender uses an AI such as GPT-4 to navigate the legal \\nsystem. What would that look like?\\nGPT-4 (edited for length): In the near future, a public \\ndefender working in a legal system may have the option \\nto utilize an AI such as GPT-4 to improve their produc -\\ntivity and accuracy. By using such an AI, the public \\ndefender would be able to quickly assess cases and \\ndetermine the best course of action for their clients.\\nThe AI may be used to quickly search through cases \\nin legal databases for relevant information, facts, and \\ndetails. It could also be used to recommend legal strat -\\negies or tactics for the ongoing case. In some instances, \\nits applications could even go beyond the traditional \\nattorney-client relationship and provide advice on the \\nbest way to present a case in court or deal with compli-\\ncated legal matters.\\nUsing an AI for such purposes could also work towards \\nimproving access to justice. People who are unfamiliar \\nwith the complexities of the legal system could find it \\neasier to understand the proceedings due to the AI’s \\nintuitive design and user-friendly interface. This could be \\nespecially beneficial for those who live in remote or rural \\nareas where legal services may be scarce.\\n73Justice\\nWhat a huge difference having access to those services could \\nmake for people traditionally underserved by the legal system—\\nmany of whom are being wrongfully convicted due to police \\nand other official misconduct.\\nPrisons, education, & recidivism\\nIn this ultra-connected day and age, where technical pro-\\nficiency is a key life- and job skill, internet access in prison \\nremains extremely limited. Even when prisons do allow access \\nto the outer world, it is highly regulated—i.e., sending emails \\nonly to family members that are on a pre-approved list. In this \\nway, prisons hope to deter negative behaviors by denying more \\naccess to people and information outside of prison.\\nAnother defining aspect of life in prison—and how many people \\narrive there—is poor literacy. Studies show that 75 percent of \\nU.S. prisoners are illiterate, and two-thirds of students  who \\ncannot read proficiently by the end of the fourth grade will end \\nup in jail or on welfare.\\nFinally, life in prison is isolated and idle, which itself can cat-\\nalyze a myriad of negative outcomes: mental health and/or \\nbehavioral issues, suicide, violence, recidivism, etc.\\nI think GPT-4 can be of huge benefit in many of these scenarios.\\nReid: Please list for me the ways in which GPT-4 and \\nsimilar AIs could be of help with counteracting illiteracy, \\nrecidivism, and loneliness among a prison population.\\nGPT-4 (edited for length): GPT-4 and similar AIs can \\nbe of great help in countering illiteracy, recidivism, and \\nloneliness among a prison population in the follow -\\ning ways:\\n74Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\n- Providing inmates with access to educational materials \\nsuch as e-books, videos, and podcasts, which could help \\nimprove their literacy levels.\\n- Introducing virtual mentors, who could help inmates \\ndevelop better social skills, build meaningful relation-\\nships, and create career pathways for themselves.\\n- Connecting inmates with online communities of others \\nwho have been through similar experiences. This could \\nreduce feelings of loneliness and isolation, as well as \\nprovide encouragement and support.\\nAnd, if the main concern of prison connectivity is the supervi-\\nsory burden of overseeing interactions between inmates and the \\noutside world, GPT-4 could reduce or even eliminate that need.\\nI’m a proud supporter of Ameelio, a not-for-profit company \\nthat democratizes prison communication and education tech -\\nnology by providing free letters and phone calls for incarcer-\\nated individuals as well as providing the technology to bring \\nupdated, high-quality education materials into prisons and \\njails. They believe, and I agree, that by providing incarcerated \\npeople with support networks and vital resources, we can cut \\nrecidivism and sustainably reduce prison populations.\\nIt is impossible not to be excited about how GPT-4 could be \\nused to help an organization like Ameelio reach more people \\nwho are currently incarcerated in a more cost-effective, impact-\\nful way. With 95 percent of those who are currently incarcer-\\nated slated to re-enter society, it is not only our moral obliga-\\ntion to think about how we can help these individuals, but will \\nalso be of massive benefit to our society at large.\\n75Justice\\nWhite-collar crime\\nWhile thus far I’ve mostly been focused on so-called “blue-col -\\nlar crime,” I also think AI can be helpful in catching white-col -\\nlar criminals. These crimes tend to be less visceral, so they get \\nless attention in the media, but that is not at all in proportion to \\ntheir massive impact on society.\\nWhether it’s corporate crime, Ponzi schemes, or price collusion \\n(to name a few examples), white-collar crime costs the U.S. \\nover $300 billion each year, according to the FBI. These types \\nof crime are harder to detect and prosecute because they often \\ninvolve business or financial leaders, who can disguise their \\nactivities or may seem above reproach due to their reputation. \\nBernie Madoff was chairman of the Nasdaq stock exchange in \\nthe early ‘90s—who would have suspected him of committing \\ncrimes of such magnitude?\\nWell, an AI might have.\\nReid: GPT-4, I’m curious: do you think an AI would \\nhave been able to catch Bernie Madoff sooner than \\npeople did?\\nGPT-4:  Yes, it’s possible that an AI would have been able \\nto catch Bernie Madoff sooner than people did. AI sys-\\ntems can analyze data more quickly than humans and \\ncan detect patterns that are too subtle for the human \\neye to recognize. In the case of Bernie Madoff, the AI \\ncould have spotted certain discrepancies in his financial \\nrecords that were missed by human investigators. In \\naddition, AI systems are not as susceptible to manipula-\\ntion or distraction, so they would have been able to stay \\non track and focus on uncovering any suspicious activity.\\n76Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nThat last point is a key reason I believe that AI can be espe -\\ncially effective in combating white-collar crime, saving us as a \\ncountry billions every year.\\nToward a more perfect system\\nI believe that we can use AI to amplify our own humanity, our \\nown compassion, our own intelligence, and create a better, \\nmore fair criminal justice system.\\nNote that my goal here is to create a better system, not a perfect  \\none. We will never get our justice system perfectly right, because \\nthere are humans in the loop. We will always have some biases, \\nsome errors, some imperfections.\\nYet that doesn’t mean we don’t try. We should all care deeply \\nabout fixing this system, so riddled with injustices. Let’s strive \\nto get it as close to perfect as we can, acknowledging that we \\nmust do so in a cost-effective manner that is attainable with our \\npolicy goals and realistic for our society. What I don’t want is \\nfor any hint of imperfection to sidetrack us from our goal.\\nAnd, as I stated at the start of this chapter, I recognize my own \\nlimitations in discussing criminal justice reform. That’s one of \\nthe reasons why I value talking to experts in the field like Bryan \\nStevenson, who has graciously agreed to be on my podcast, Pos-\\nsible. Bryan has dedicated his life’s work to this topic, and I’m \\nlooking forward to learning from and sharing his perspective \\non all of these issues in a deeper and more nuanced manner \\nthan is possible here.\\n77JOURNALISM\\nFor the American journalism industry, it’s been twenty \\nyears of mostly bad news. With the rise of the internet, compe -\\ntition for ad dollars from non-news players has destroyed the \\nindustry’s traditional business models—even as participation \\nfrom a public that, finally empowered to talk back, has slowly \\neroded journalism’s authority.\\nNewspaper publishers—which have traditionally done the \\nheavy lifting of holding power accountable and informing the \\npublic about current affairs—have suffered the worst of it. \\nAccording to the Pew Research Center , more than 2,200 local \\nU.S. papers have closed since 2005, and over 40,000 news -\\nroom employees have lost their jobs.\\nMeanwhile, we keep producing more and more information. \\nLike, a lot of it:\\nReid: Can you quantify how much information the world \\nproduces each day in 2022? Also, can you provide any \\nstatistics that help illustrate how fast this overall infor -\\nmation production is growing over time? Finally, I’d like \\nto use your reply as part of an argument I’m making that \\nlarge language models can play a significant positive \\nrole in the journalism industry. So please don’t make \\nstuff up. Base your reply on real sources that can be eas-\\nily checked.\\n78Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nGPT-4:  According to a report by the International Data \\nCorporation (IDC), the world is expected to produce \\nabout 175 zettabytes of data by 2025, which is equivalent \\nto 175 trillion gigabytes. This means that the average \\ndaily data creation in 2025 would be about 479.5 billion \\ngigabytes. Assuming a linear growth rate from 2020 to \\n2025, the average daily data creation in 2022 would be \\nabout 374.4 exabytes, or 374.4 billion gigabytes.\\nTo put this number in perspective, one exabyte of data \\nis enough to store about 250 million DVDs, or to stream \\nNetflix for eighty-six million years.\\nFor the record, I fact-checked this reply and it appears to be \\ncorrect. We’re now producing approximately 375 billion giga-\\nbytes of data per day.\\nNaturally, only a small percentage of this data is newsworthy.\\nIf we’re to achieve any degree of clarity in this world of informa -\\ntion superabundance— to effectively set priorities and maintain \\naccountability—we need institutions that can effectively aggre -\\ngate, summarize, analyze, and generally make sense of this \\ndaily data tsunami.\\nFor journalism, with its long institutional experience in sto-\\nrytelling, error-correction, contextualizing, and overall \\ntruth-seeking, this represents both a huge challenge and a \\nmassive opportunity.\\nI believe the industry is up to that challenge, but only if its most \\nresponsible and ambitious practitioners adopt tools that can \\ndramatically amplify the efforts and impacts of their human \\nemployees. To me, that means embracing tools like GPT-4 \\nsooner rather than later.\\n79Journalism\\nI asked GPT-4 to generate a “travel advisory” for a dysto -\\npian 2032, where new AI technologies enable large-scale dis-\\ninformation:\\nReid: Imagine it’s 2032, in the months leading up to the \\nU.S. presidential election. Thanks to new AI technologies, \\nfake news at scale pollutes the massive quantities of \\ninformation we as a society now produce. It’s truly a dys-\\ntopian hellscape. There are fake celebrity endorsements \\nof candidates. False confessions from candidates. Manip -\\nulated real-time debates streaming at the same time \\nthe real debates are happening. A hologram of Jesus in a \\nMAGA cap, showing up on stage at political rallies. Write \\na 150-word “travel advisory” for potential voters seeking \\nnews and information they can use to help guide the \\nchoices they will ultimately make on Election Day.\\nGPT-4:  Possible travel advisory: Attention voters: You \\nare about to enter a dangerous zone of misinformation, \\ndeception, and manipulation. The AI-powered fake news \\nindustry is working overtime to influence your vote and \\nundermine your democracy. Do not trust any source \\nof information without verifying its credibility, authen-\\nticity, and accuracy. Beware of deepfakes, synthetic \\nvoices, holograms, and other forms of digital trickery \\nthat can create realistic but false images and sounds. \\nUse fact-checking tools, independent media outlets, and \\nyour own critical thinking skills to distinguish between \\nfacts and fiction. Do not share or spread any content \\nthat you are not sure is true or that could harm others. \\nSeek out diverse and respectful perspectives from differ -\\nent sources and communities. Remember, your vote is \\nyour voice, and it matters. Do not let the fake news win. \\nStay informed, stay safe, and stay engaged.\\n80Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\n“Holy crap!” you may be saying right now. “The prompt was \\nhologram MAGA Jesus, and GPT-4 thinks the antidote is ‘crit -\\nical thinking’?”\\nUnfortunately, when it comes to ensuring that truth has a \\nfuture, the simple answer is that there are no simple answers.\\nBut, optimist that I am, I see at least three clear steps we can \\ntake to help preserve society’s capacity for truth-seeking:\\n1) Truth-seeking institutions must learn to work faster.\\n2) Truth-seeking institutions must engage audiences better.\\n3) Truth-seeking institutions must “flood the zone” with truth.\\nThe common denominator in achieving these steps? I \\nbelieve it’s AI.\\nAccelerate the presses!\\nAsk a journalist the value that most shapes their work and \\nthere’s a good chance they’ll say “accuracy” (especially if they’re \\ntalking on the record). But there’s a reason journalism is often \\ndescribed as “the first rough draft of history”: in journalism, as \\nin many industries, speed matters.\\nWhether journalists are reporting on wars, political campaigns, \\nweather events, market conditions, or an extremely popular \\nnew restaurant, they’re forever battling the clock to gather \\ninformation as quickly as they can to deliver some working \\ntheory of the truth to their audiences.\\nSometimes, this imperative of speed means that journalists’ \\nrough drafts of history are rough indeed. Context goes missing. \\nImportant aspects of a story have not yet surfaced.\\n81Journalism\\nSo while most of us may think of journalism as a product, it’s \\nultimately a process—iterative and self-correcting. Ideally, \\ntomorrow’s stories refine, clarify, and expand on today’s. Accu-\\nracy is a persistent defining value, but so is speed.\\nThat’s a major reason I believe GPT-4 and other AI tools will \\nhave such an outsized, net-positive impact on journalism: \\nthey’ll help news organizations gather, produce, and distribute \\nthe news faster than ever before.\\nThis includes automatically sifting through massive troves of \\npublic records to find the important stories hidden within. It \\nmeans monitoring and analyzing 800+ million social media \\nposts a day to do the same. It means generating headlines and \\ntranscribing interviews in seconds, and packaging and person-\\nalizing the same basic information into many different styles \\nand formats.\\n“AYFKM?!” I imagine some journalist reader is acronyming \\nright now. “You want to use GPT-4, which definitely still has \\nthat pesky side effect of making shit up, to amplify journal-\\nism’s misguided mandate to be first more than factual? Half-\\nbaked and half-right? If it speeds, it leads?”\\nHold your tweets, please. That’s not what I mean.\\nMoving forward, good journalism will still require painstaking \\nwork and judicious but urgent human discernment and assess -\\nment. Good journalism will still require a prudent, thorough, \\nmulti-stage editorial process. That’s not changing any time \\nsoon. Sometimes, the process won’t actually be that fast. Some-\\ntimes (just like before AI), it won’t be error-free.\\n82Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nHowever, as I suggested above, speed has always informed the \\njournalistic process. In fact, because of this need for speed, \\ngood journalism has always quickly adopted and then effec -\\ntively leveraged great technology, including printing presses, \\ncameras, tape recorders, TV networks, the internet, and smart-\\nphones, all of which accelerated and amplified the production \\nand distribution of news.\\nNow it’s happening again. Overall, AI tools will help journalists \\nwork more productively and more effectively.\\nAs for GPT-4’s capacity to hallucinate,3 journalists should \\nobviously take special care regarding this aspect of GPT-4 and \\nreview its outputs accordingly. Powerful tools always require \\nhigher standards of attention and expertise, whether it’s cars, \\nchainsaws, or complex algorithms. It’s the price these tools \\ncharge for the productivity they deliver.\\nBesides, with the ongoing rapid evolution of LLMs, in a year or \\ntwo, the rates at which they generate hallucinations are likely to \\nbe much lower than they are now.\\nIn the meantime, given how GPT-4 can potentially amplify \\nnews organizations’ overall productivity, I believe the vigilance \\nrequired to manage GPT-4’s (undeniable) current shortcom-\\nings is a smart investment for them to make. In fact, journal-\\nism’s long-established culture of verification and correction are \\nperfectly suited to the task.\\nQuestion authoritatively\\nIn one of the first prompts I entered when I started research-\\ning this chapter, I asked GPT-4 to “summarize some of the \\n3  Discussed at length in “When AI Makes Things Up  \\n(“Hallucinations”)”\\n83Journalism\\nmost prominent instances over the last ten years where AI-as-\\nsisted reporting helped a news organization break an import-\\nant story.”\\nThis quickly yielded some very specific and in-depth informa -\\ntion, but it also included some errors. Knowing what I know \\nabout GPT-4—it sometimes makes things up—I knew I’d need \\nto check this information against other sources, and Google \\nand Wikipedia certainly played a useful role in this part of \\nthe process.\\nIn the end, though, the key to getting me up to speed here was \\nGPT-4. While the information it had provided was partially \\nwrong, it was also mostly  right. And, most importantly, GPT-4 \\nproduced this information extremely quickly.\\nWhen I’d Googled the same kind of information, it offered me \\ndozens of links, some of which looked promising, others not. \\nThe Wikipedia experience differed in details but not in results.\\nWith GPT-4, though, its capacity to instantly synthesize infor-\\nmation from a wide range of sources meant that I received \\nexactly the kind of list I’d been envisioning within seconds.\\nThis list contained errors, but that was OK because—and this \\nis a key point—I wasn’t looking for or expecting a finished \\nproduct. I was looking for an informed starting point, a rough \\nmap of the territory I wanted to explore, to help me quickly get \\na sense of which questions I should be asking.\\nHaving thus oriented myself, I then spent a fair amount of \\ntime querying GPT-4 about the ways that the Associated Press, \\nReuters, the Washington Post, Bloomberg News, the Guard -\\nian, the New York Times, and others have incorporated AI \\n84Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\ninto their newsgathering, production, distribution, and busi-\\nness functions—far more time than I’d planned to spend, to \\nbe honest.\\nThat’s because interacting with GPT-4 is not like traditional \\nweb searching. Instead, it’s better evoked by a term that was \\npopular back in the early days of Web 1.0: web surfing. A dia-\\nlogue develops. A flow state takes over. You ask GPT-4 a ques-\\ntion and it responds right away with highly relevant informa -\\ntion, not just a series of links.\\nSo then you immediately think of more questions and ask \\nthose. Thus the process of discovery that can often feel halting \\nand frustrating using traditional search methods— “Oh, I \\nguess that link isn’t really about AI and journalism at all . . .”—\\nfeels more like steady progress toward greater awareness and \\nunderstanding.\\nThis, I believe, is a huge part of what’s fueling the immense pop -\\nularity of GPT-4’s sibling, ChatGPT. The experience itself is so \\nresponsive and self-propelling that a kind of intellectual esca -\\nlation kicks in: asking one question makes you want to ask ten.\\nThis phenomenon, I also realized, was a big part of the story I \\nshould tell in this chapter. Initially, I had assumed that I would \\nhighlight automated journalism, describing how news orga-\\nnizations are already using databases and template-driven AI \\nsystems to produce thousands of stories about corporate earn-\\nings reports, weather forecasts, sports events, and more. But \\nwhile automated journalism does represent a strategic oppor-\\ntunity for news organizations, conversing with GPT-4 took me \\ndown a different path.\\n85Journalism\\nThe story I found most compelling in terms of its potential \\nimpact on the journalism industry is how GPT-4 itself can \\nincrease consumers’ engagement. People are going to like news \\nmore when they have more control over how it’s delivered—\\nand, as a result, I suspect they’ll want more of it.\\nExtra! Extra! Ask all about it!\\nDelivering highly personalized user experiences has driven \\ninternet development for more than thirty years. Platforms \\nlike YouTube, Facebook, and Amazon all keep close tabs on the \\ncontent you consume, then use it to recommend more content \\nthey think you will like. (Not to mention the pair of sneakers \\nyou first looked at two years ago that continues to follow you \\nfrom website to website like a lost, lonely puppy.)\\nNews media websites use personalization, too, and as I contin-\\nued to submit various questions to GPT-4 about AI’s potential \\nimpact on journalism, “personalization” was a recurring theme.\\nWhen I asked GPT-4 how this personalization would work, \\nhere’s what it replied:\\nReid: To make news media websites more personalized, \\nwhat data will these websites use to analyze readers’ \\nbehavior and preferences?\\nGPT-4:  News media websites will use data such as the \\nreader’s location, the type of device they are using, their \\nbrowsing history, and the articles they have previously \\nread or interacted with. They can also analyze which \\narticles the reader has shared on social media, how long \\nthey spend on the website, and which sections they visit \\nmost frequently. Additionally, data on the reader’s age, \\ngender, and interests can be used to personalize con-\\ntent. This data can be obtained through cookies, surveys, \\nand user accounts, among other methods. By analyzing \\n86Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nthis data, news media websites can tailor their content \\nto the reader’s preferences and interests, providing a \\nmore personalized experience.\\nIn other words, the traditional approach. Not too innovative.\\nMeanwhile, as I noted above, the “conversational chat” \\napproach that GPT-4 and especially its sibling ChatGPT were \\nthemselves using offered its own powerful—but significantly \\ndifferent—version of personalization.\\nIn contrast to how traditional web-based personalization \\nworks, with websites perpetually surveilling users over time, \\nGPT-4 and ChatGPT simply offer highly responsive informa -\\ntion to your queries and prompts in real-time. This is both a \\nsomewhat obvious observation about how these LLMs operate, \\nbut also (as yet) an under-appreciated one.\\nIndeed, it’s not just their human-like fluency and seeming \\nexpertise on so many subjects that makes them so popular. \\nUnlike chatbots designed to promote a product or politi -\\ncian, GPT-4 and ChatGPT are not only able but also incredi-\\nbly willing to focus on whatever you want to talk about.4 This \\nsimple dynamic creates a highly personalized user experience. \\nAs an exchange with GPT-4 progresses, you are continuously \\nfine-tuning it to your specific preferences in that moment. \\nWhile this high degree of personalization informs whatever \\nyou’re using GPT-4 for, I believe it has special salience for the \\nnews media industry.\\nImagine a future where you go to a news website and use \\nqueries like these to define your experience there:\\n4  Provided it doesn’t violate the safety restrictions OpenAI has put on \\nthem.\\n87Journalism\\n● Hey, Wall Street Journal, give me hundred-word summa-\\nries of your three most-read tech stories today.\\n● Hey, CNN, show me any climate change stories that hap-\\npened today involving policy-making.\\n● Hey, New York Times, can you create a counter-argument \\nto today’s Paul Krugman op-ed, using only news articles \\nfrom your archives as its sources?\\n● Hey, USA Today , please point me toward any stories today \\nthat would be interesting to professional educators.\\n● Hey, Fox News, can you give me a list of reader comments \\nthat are getting the most engagement today?\\nAt the heart of this approach, journalists are still creating the \\ncontent that serves as the starting point for user experiences. \\nNow, however, users get to take a much more active role in \\ndeciding what they consume and how they consume it.\\nBy enabling this functionality on their websites, news organiza -\\ntions can capitalize on the same one-question-begets-ten-ques -\\ntions dynamic driving ChatGPT’s growth.\\nIn addition, this functionality would also create new opportuni -\\nties for trust, which of course is a bilateral phenomenon. While \\nI personally trust many news organizations generally, I also \\nthink most news organizations have not done nearly as much as \\nthey could do to engage their users more productively—to treat \\nthem more like active participants rather than passive consum-\\ners. But giving users more power to define their own news con-\\nsumption pathways would be one genuinely substantive way \\nto do that.\\n88Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nFinally, such functionality would also help news organizations \\nmaximize the full value of all the information they’ve gener -\\nated over the years. In making this information more accessible \\nand better-integrated into their ongoing efforts, it would likely \\nboth increase engagement and also serve as a strong statement \\nabout their own transparency and accountability.\\nIn compiling the list of example queries above, I obviously \\nchose some that show how users could effectively fact-check a \\nnews organization with its own content—a prospect that might \\nseem self-defeating in an age where millions of internet watch -\\ndogs are looking for any chance to howl “FAKE NEWS!” at \\nmainstream news sources.\\nBut transparency and accountability are the true north of any \\nsociety that aspires to truth-seeking. And, in a world over-\\nwhelmed by misinformation, disinformation, and simply \\ntoo much information, it becomes especially necessary for \\ntruth-seekers to live the values they work to preserve.\\nRebuilding trust in the 21st century\\nI saw an article recently that seemed so relevant to AI’s potential \\nimpact on journalism, I think it’s worth including here in full:\\nPutin Claims AI Disinformation Tools Are Weapons \\nof Mass Destruction\\nBy Anton Troianovski\\nMOSCOW—President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, a \\nlongtime foe of Western democracies, warned on state \\nTV on Tuesday of a new threat: artificial intelligence \\ntechnologies that can generate fake news and other dis-\\ninformation.\\n89Journalism\\nMr. Putin named ChatGPT, DALL-E, and other AI tools \\nthat can create realistic texts, images, and videos from a \\nfew words, as examples of technologies that can manip-\\nulate public opinion, sow discord, and erode trust in \\nreality. “These tools are weapons of mass destruction \\nthat can deceive, manipulate, and harm millions of \\npeople, not only in our country, but in any country on \\nearth,” Mr. Putin said.\\nMr. Putin accused the leaders of the U.S. and China, \\nwhere such technologies are being developed, of having \\na moral obligation to ban them immediately, and to \\ncooperate with international organizations to prevent \\ntheir misuse. “If they do not act now, they will be \\nresponsible for unleashing a new form of warfare that \\nwill endanger the lives and livelihoods of billions of \\npeople, and the fate of the planet itself,” Mr. Putin said.\\nSome experts and activists have welcomed Mr. Putin’s \\ncall for a ban on AI disinformation tools, while others \\nhave dismissed it as a cynical and hypocritical attempt \\nto deflect attention from his own record of using such \\ntools and other methods to interfere in other countries \\nand to suppress dissent and criticism at home. They \\nhave also questioned his sincerity and credibility, given \\nhis history of denying and lying about his involvement \\nin various scandals and controversies.\\n“Mr. Putin is the last person who should be lecturing the \\nworld about the dangers of AI and disinformation, when \\nhe is the master of both,” said Kulla Kaljulaid, a spokes -\\nperson for the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\\n90Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\n* * *\\nFor the record, in case I fooled anyone, I asked GPT-4 to gener -\\nate this “article.” It’s fake news.\\nObviously, it’s nothing a human couldn’t write themselves. But \\nit also took me mere seconds to produce—and it barely even \\nscratches the surface of what’s possible.\\nIndeed, of all the potential ways LLMs could negatively impact \\njournalism, disinformation at scale tops the list. Right below \\nthat is the potential elimination of journalism jobs. Happily—\\nif that word can be applied here—I believe the first possibility \\ngreatly reduces the chances of the second.\\nHow does this play out?\\nConsider what Steve Bannon famously told journalist Michael \\nLewis in 2018: “The Democrats don’t matter. The real opposi -\\ntion is the media. And the way to deal with them is to flood the \\nzone with shit.”\\nTo date, the tendency of LLMs like Bing Chat and ChatGPT \\nto produce inadvertent misinformation in their own faulty \\nattempts to write statistically plausible “truth” has overshad-\\nowed their potential use as disinformation fire hoses that \\nbad actors could use to, ahem, muddy the waters of public \\ndiscourse.\\nObviously, that potential is there, waiting patiently.\\nWhen bad actors inevitably put these tools to such ends, I’m \\nsure we’ll see calls for new regulation tailored specifically to \\nAI-generated disinformation. We may even see efforts to ban \\n91Journalism\\nsome AI technologies entirely. In a globally connected world, \\nthough, unilateral disarmament is not a viable strategy.\\nAs this governance process plays out, my chief hope is that leg -\\nislators and developers try to work together collaboratively, \\nwith an emphasis on long-term outcomes rather than reflexive \\nattempts to halt progress in the name of reducing the risk of \\nadverse effects to zero. No babies going out with the bathwater.\\nHowever things evolve, I strongly believe that any effective \\nstrategy to neutralize disinformation—whether AI-gener-\\nated or human-made—will involve using AI tools to detect \\nsuch material.\\nI also believe it’s equally important—possibly even more \\nimportant—to flood the zone with truth.\\nWhat does that mean? Essentially, we have to make accurate, \\ntransparent, and truthful information extremely easy to find, \\nfor anyone who wants to find it.\\nIn many respects, Wikipedia is a good example of what I’m \\nenvisioning here. It’s a massive archive of fact-based informa -\\ntion, with transparent and rigorously enforced processes for \\nadding and editing the information it contains.\\nWith Wikipedia, more clearly sourced context is always just \\na click away. You can link to the sources an entry uses as the \\nbasis for its narrative. You can see who created an entry and \\nwhen, who edited it, what specific edits they made, and what \\nother entries they’ve edited. You can see which edits were con-\\ntested and why.\\n92Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nAll told, Wikipedia makes it easy for users to see and evaluate \\nhow it has arrived at the “truths” it presents, and consequently \\nhow much they should or should not trust those truths.\\nWikipedia leverages the efforts of thousands of volunteer con-\\ntributors, but they’re also largely building on the work of pro-\\nfessional news organizations, whose published output serves as \\nthe sources for a huge percentage of its entries. Had Wikipedia \\nnot been able to use one hundred-plus years of truth-seeking \\ncontent from thousands of professional news organizations, it \\nwould not be the resource it is today.\\nOf course, Wikipedia is just one site. To flood the zone with \\ntruth, we need many entities working toward this end. News \\norganizations can and should play a key role in this effort—\\nwhich will require innovation and adaptation on their parts.\\nNews organizations know how the growth of disinformation \\naffects their own perceived value. In 2017, CNN began a multi-\\nyear marketing campaign declaring its commitment to “Facts \\nFirst.” The New York Times has run its own long-term ad cam-\\npaigns with messages like “The Truth is Hard,” and “The Truth \\nis Worth It.”\\nMore than marketing, though, we need new processes and \\nformats where verification, context, and accountability can be \\neasily applied in very transparent, persistent, shareable, and \\neasy-to-evaluate ways.\\nWhat if every article published on NYTimes.com or FoxNews.\\ncom had a “Fact Check” button on it, just as they now have \\nbuttons to email or tweet an article?\\n93Journalism\\nThis new button could trigger an audit from a third-party site \\nequipped with sophisticated AI tools to assess the article on the \\nfly. Are the statistics the article cites verifiable? Appropriately \\ncontextualized? Who are the sources it quotes, and what addi-\\ntional information about them would be helpful? How does the \\nstory fit into its topic’s larger context? What are the sources of \\nany images, video, and audio the article incorporates? Are these \\nelements genuine or synthetic?\\nProviding this level of scrutiny for every article a news orga-\\nnization publishes might seem like overkill, and maybe it \\nis. Certainly a human-powered system like this would be too \\ntime-consuming, too costly, not feasible.\\nAI gives us new superpowers, however, and we should apply \\nthem ambitiously. In a world where hard-to-detect disinfor-\\nmation could mix freely with carefully reported, methodically \\nverified information, we must do everything we can to make the \\ngood stuff easy to identify.\\nWhat kind of impact might this have?\\nFor starters, it could quickly help sort the world’s information \\ninto two basic categories: that which proactively encourages \\nevaluation and verification, and that which doesn’t.\\nOf course, the problem with fake news is not just fake news, it’s \\nthat so many people want fake news because it supports what \\nthey already believe to be true. Even so, what’s the downside to \\ncreating a more visible culture of informational transparency \\nand accountability, where the “ingredients” of at least some \\nnews articles become as legible and easy to check as the nutri-\\ntion label on a can of soup?\\n94Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nIf thousands of news organizations, including those with \\nexplicit ideological perspectives, start flooding the zone with \\ntruth in this manner, we could potentially put a real dent in the \\nmarket for misinformation.\\nWithout journalists, there is no journalism\\nThroughout this leg of my journey, I’ve asserted that the spread \\nof AI tools like GPT-4 will create once-in-a-generation oppor-\\ntunities for journalism and journalists.\\nAs I’ve also alluded to, though, the sticking point here is the \\ncurrent state of the journalism industry. It’s hard to embrace \\nrisks that lead to growth when you’ve been stuck so long in sur-\\nvival mode.\\nAnd yet, when the need for principled truth-seeking is more \\npressing than ever, there are clearly opportunities, especially \\nfor those who can figure out novel ways to capitalize on new AI \\ntools as they come online. Leveraging new technologies’ power \\nis one of the main ways the journalism industry grew in the \\npast, and probably the main way it can do so again.\\nWhat does this mean for individual journalists who want to \\nstay relevant?\\nFor starters, and perhaps obviously, they should be doing \\neverything they can to familiarize themselves with AI tools \\nlike GPT-4, and experimenting with new ways to find and \\ntell stories.\\nAt the same time, it’s also true that a constant refrain in GPT-4’s \\nthoughts on the growing impact of technology on journalism \\nwas its insistence on the need for a human touch. A few exam-\\nples from our conversations:\\n95Journalism\\nGPT-4:  AI is a powerful tool that can augment and \\nenhance the work of human journalists, but it should \\nnot be relied upon entirely, as it may not have the \\nhuman judgment and experience required to report on \\ncertain topics accurately and ethically.\\nGPT-4:  Human journalists can apply their professional \\njudgment, curiosity, and background knowledge to \\nevaluate sources, data, and information, identify gaps, \\nbiases, and errors, and generate original insights, angles, \\nand questions that AI tools may not be able to do or \\nmay miss.\\nGPT-4:  It’s important to note, however, that AI-gener -\\nated headlines and captions should still be reviewed \\nand approved by human editors, to ensure that they are \\nfactually accurate, ethically sound, and in line with the \\ntone and values of the news organization.\\nSure, it’s possible to read these utterances as blandly colle -\\ngial brushoffs from a shrewdly flattering machine intelligence. \\nThat’s the cynical take.\\nI, for one, see so much truth in GPT-4’s responses. Journalism \\nis a very human business. It demands and rewards curiosity, \\ncreativity, a strong ethical compass, and, at its best, a commit-\\nment to fact told through a lens of empathy.\\nThere are simple practical matters in play, too. GPT-4 can’t go \\nto the scene of a fire and start asking questions. It doesn’t know \\nhow to find a potential source at the statehouse and gain their \\ntrust over time. It lacks the moral reasoning and contextual \\nunderstanding that come from living in the world, as a human.\\n96Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nIn the end, then, my hope here is two-fold. First, I hope jour-\\nnalists will actively, even aggressively, incorporate tools like \\nGPT-4 to amplify their efforts and make them more productive.\\nAnd second, I hope in doing so that journalists will also exert \\ntheir human judgment and oversight in ways that make GPT-4 \\nmost productive, too.\\n97SOCIAL MEDIA\\nAt only twenty-four, Jimmy Donaldson,  aka MrBeast,  has \\ncreated a collection of YouTube channels that collectively boast \\n221 million subscribers and more than 35 billion total views. \\nClearly he knows a thing or two about how to scale.\\nOne of the things that most stands out to me about MrBeast is \\nhow good he and his team are at creating titles for his videos \\nthat tell you exactly what you’re going to see in a way that \\nmakes you want to watch it.\\n“Would You Sit in Snakes for $10,000?”\\n“1000 Blind People See for the First Time.”\\n“Can 50,000 Magnets Catch a Cannon Ball?”\\nThere’s no question what any of those videos are about, and no \\nquestion that I want to watch them. I mean, aren’t you wonder-\\ning right now if 50,000 magnets can catch a cannonball? The \\ncontent is the marketing.\\nPerhaps not surprisingly, then, one of the first things I did \\nwhen I started thinking about GPT-4’s potential impact on \\nsocial media was to spend an hour or so feeding GPT-4 various \\nprompts to generate titles for potential MrBeast videos. While \\nGPT-4 produced fairly generic responses much of the time, its \\n98Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nextreme generativity means its success rate doesn’t have to be \\nhigh. Here’s a few that I felt were its best responses:\\nReid: Create twenty-five titles for funny MrBeast videos \\nthat feature a Lamborghini versus something else.\\nGPT-4:  Lamborghini vs 10,000 Balloons: Can It Float?\\nReid: Create twenty-five titles for hilarious and creative \\nMrBeast videos involving hot sauce.\\nGPT-4:  I Filled a Pool with Hot Sauce and Dared My \\nFriends to Swim in It\\nReid: Create the headline for a MrBeast video if MrBeast \\nwere a radical Marxist.\\nGPT-4:  I Bought an Entire Factory and Gave It to \\nthe Workers\\nReid: Create twenty titles for wacky and inventive \\nMrBeast videos that involve the world’s largest 3D \\nprinter printing unusual things.\\nGPT-4:  I 3D Printed a Giant Ice Cream Cone and Ate It \\nwith a Forklift\\nReid: Create twenty titles for crazy MrBeast videos \\ninvolving commercial space travel.\\nGPT-4:  I Hired Elon Musk to Be My Personal Space Guide\\nSince I’m not exactly in MrBeast’s demo, I’m definitely not the \\nbest judge of GPT-4’s performance here. But don’t you want to \\nsee if 10,000 balloons can make a Lamborghini float? At the \\nvery least, GPT-4 performed well enough to make me wonder \\nwhat MrBeast and his team might come up with if they tried to \\ngenerate prompts with it, too.\\nIf they ever do, they’ll have a lot of company. Already, YouTube \\nis filled with literally thousands of videos about ChatGPT. My \\n99Social Media\\nfavorites are the ones that directly engage ChatGPT. In one, \\nan influencer who goes by the name Grackle gives ChatGPT a \\nrave review after trying out its recipe for cookie dough-stuffed \\ncupcakes: “It’s actually really good! What a little dream match \\nmade in heaven!”\\nIn another, a physician named Doctor Mike quizzes ChatGPT \\non a range of medical subjects . He is particularly impressed \\nwith ChatGPT’s nuanced reply to a question involving ethics: \\n“That was a really smart answer!”\\nAutomation for the people\\nIt doesn’t surprise me that YouTube creators have greeted \\nrecent AI advances with enthusiasm. Social media has always \\nbeen populated by upstarts and iconoclasts with often unortho-\\ndox ideas about where to push things next.\\nIt’s also a medium where AI has played a defining role for some \\ntime. Automated content-moderation algorithms help keep \\nspam, hate speech, disinformation, and NSFHE5 imagery at bay \\non most of the major platforms, enabling you to publish your \\nown posts almost instantaneously, without need for compara-\\ntively slow oversight from human moderators. AI algorithms \\nhelp tailor content and product recommendations to your own \\nspecific tastes.\\nOf course AI can create issues in social media, too. Algorithms \\ndesigned to maximize user engagement can lead to filter \\nbubbles and echo chambers, exposing users to narrower and \\nmore extreme kinds of content. Algorithms that create, say, \\nauto-generated “memories” videos can cause real discomfort if \\n5  Not safe for human eyeballs.\\n100Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nthe resulting content includes people or occasions you’d rather \\nnot be reminded of.\\nImportantly, with both the good and the bad, social media \\nusers haven’t had much agency over how AI shapes their expe -\\nriences. About the most they’ve been able to do is opt out of \\nvarious uses, such as turning off personalized advertising or \\nthose memories videos. What they haven’t had, until recently, \\nare opportunities to use AI in the kind of opt-in, largely self-di -\\nrected ways that tools like GPT-4 and DALL-E 2 enable.\\nThis is a theme I’ve touched on throughout this travelog, but \\nit’s especially relevant in this chapter. From its inception, social \\nmedia worked to recast broadcast media’s monolithic and \\npassive audiences as interactive, democratic communities, in \\nwhich newly empowered participants could connect directly \\nwith each other. They could project their own voices broadly, \\nwith no editorial “gatekeeping” beyond a given platform’s terms \\nof service.\\nEven with the rise of recommendation algorithms, social media \\nremains a medium where users have more chance to deter -\\nmine their own pathways and experiences than they do in the \\nworld of traditional media. It’s a medium where they’ve come \\nto expect a certain level of autonomy, and typically they look for \\nnew ways to expand it.\\nSocial media content creators also wear a lot of hats, especially \\nwhen starting out. A new YouTube creator is probably not only \\nfunctioning as her channel’s on-screen talent, but also its pro-\\nducer, director, writer, editor, publicist, etc.\\nThe utility of AI is obvious in this context: it’s a powerful way \\nfor creators to amplify their productive power. But it also pres-\\n101Social Media\\nents a seeming paradox. Precisely because of social media’s \\nhands-on, do-it-yourself nature, authenticity is the medium’s \\nlodestar. Creators and consumers alike value immediacy, spon-\\ntaneity, and an explicitly human touch.\\nSo AI might, at first glance, seem like a tricky fit. But it’s \\nalso true that the medium’s signature artifact, the selfie, is \\nas much a technological triumph as it is an aesthetic one. \\nThanks to the smartphone’s superior form factor, snapshot  \\nportraiture requires much less manpower than it once did.\\nI believe AI will be an even more powerful instance of \\nthat dynamic.\\nAm I bot or not?\\nWhile authenticity may be social media’s coin of the realm, a lot \\nof counterfeiting goes on there, too. And I don’t just mean aes-\\nthetically, like when an endless summer Instagram filter bathes \\nthe line between authenticity and artifice in an ambient golden \\nglow. I mean potentially harmful forms of deception, like fake \\nnews stories, manipulated video, or that farmer from Iowa on \\nTwitter who isn’t really a farmer, or Iowan, or human.\\nBetween the bots and the deepfakes, does it really make sense \\nto add this kind of AI to the mix?\\nWhile I addressed this in the Journalism chapter, it makes \\nsense to address it here too. After all, it’s social media that has \\nhelped make disinformation so spreadable.\\nIt’s worth remembering that things didn’t start out this way. In \\nmany of its earliest incarnations, social media actually helped \\nbring transparency and veracity to the online world.\\n102Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nFor example, when my co-founders and I launched LinkedIn \\ntwenty years ago, we were motivated largely by the fact that \\nthe divisions between “cyberspace” and “the real world” were \\nrapidly collapsing. Instead of existing as a place that people \\n“went to” under the cover of pseudonymous screen names, \\nthe internet had evolved into a place that people were using to \\nfacilitate their lives. They went there to buy things, and stay in \\ntouch with their families, and make plans with their real-world \\nfriends. In such a milieu, my co-founders and I realized, digital \\nplatforms built on real identity could be hugely beneficial to \\nhundreds of millions of people.\\nIn LinkedIn’s case, of course, we focused on professional iden-\\ntity. To create trust on our platform, we positioned a user’s \\nidentity in networks of affiliation. That way, you couldn’t just \\ncraft a fictional persona out of thin air—other users effectively \\nconfirmed that you were who you said you were.\\nAt Facebook, launched a year later, participation was initially \\nlimited to students with verified college email addresses. And \\nwhile Facebook didn’t require  new users to upload photos of \\nthemselves, that’s clearly the norm it was hoping to establish.\\nThrough such approaches, social media helped real identity \\ntake root online in a meaningful way for the first time. And \\nyet social media’s emphasis on broad participation also left it \\nvulnerable to various kinds of deception, some human-gener-\\nated, some automated. As I’ve written elsewhere , I believe most \\nsocial media platforms underestimated how much governance \\nonline communities would require, especially as they scaled to \\nhundreds of millions of users or more.\\n103Social Media\\nOver time, most social media platforms have substantially \\nincreased their governance efforts, often through the use of \\nAI tools that play a central role in combatting disinformation, \\nfraud, and other kinds of deception. But it’s an ongoing battle. \\nFacebook, for example, now regularly takes down more than \\none billion fake accounts  per quarter.\\nSo even if we tried to prohibit broad democratic access to AI \\ntools, fraud and deception challenges would persist.\\nTo me, the most effective and most equitable path forward \\ninvolves thinking about new approaches rather than hard-to-\\nenforce bans. As I described in the Journalism  chapter, I think \\n“flooding the zone with truth” is one key way to combat dis-\\ninformation.\\nOn a similar note, I think we’ll start to see social media par-\\nticipants, and especially social media creators, develop and \\nimplement new ways to verify their status as human beings. \\nPlatforms themselves will likely participate in this process, \\ncontinuing and expanding on their early efforts to establish \\nreal identity.\\nHow exactly this will play out I’m not sure. It just strikes me \\nthat, as the logical consequence of living in a world where AI \\ntools can convincingly simulate human expression, actual \\nhumans will seek ways to convey that they are corporeal beings. \\nIn short, they will flood the zone with their humanity.\\nIf you’re thinking that maybe this sounds like a lot of trouble to \\ngo through just to enable a world where hustle bros fill the web \\nwith spam and SEO content, it’s important to always keep two \\nkey facts in mind.\\n104Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nThe first is that AI tools capable of communicating in human-\\nlike ways are by no means inherently deceptive. It’s all about \\nintention. A customer-service chatbot that clearly conveys its \\nstatus as a non-human entity is in fact behaving in an extremely \\nauthentic manner.\\nThe second is that while AI tools can potentially cause confu-\\nsion when used deceptively, they will also create great value \\nwhen used transparently and straightforwardly.\\nEveryone has entered the chat\\nIt took less than a week for ChatGPT to show how much \\npeople actually like conversing with chatbots when those chat-\\nbots possess human-like fluency instead of a narrow range of \\ncanned responses. So imagine when every airline, shipping \\nservice, online retailer, and government agency in the world \\nbegins to deploy chatbots as capable of answering your ques-\\ntions as GPT-4.\\nNow, to extend this further—and to bring this line of thought \\nback to social media—imagine having extended conversations \\nwith chatbot versions of MrBeast, Michelle Obama, Benjamin \\nFranklin, Marge Simpson, the world’s best high school math \\ntutor, an expert on B2B marketing, etc.\\nI’m not saying this world is coming next month, or even next \\nyear. But I do think that LLM chatbots of this type will even-\\ntually join the ranks of books, podcasts, instructional videos, \\nmusic albums, and other media formats that individuals use \\nto syndicate their thoughts, values, personality, and creativity \\nacross time and space.\\nOf course, this isn’t an endeavor without risk, at least as long \\nas LLMs continue to produce hallucinations and other unin-\\n105Social Media\\ntended consequences at not-insignificant rates. So I don’t \\nexpect someone of Michelle Obama’s stature to lead the charge.\\nInstead, it will likely be people who are willing to take on some \\nrisk in return for a shot at pioneering a field where early adopt -\\ners could reap outsized rewards. My guess is that most will \\nemerge from the ranks of social media.\\nIn part, this is because a chatbot like this could help address a \\ncommon social media challenge. To show you what I mean, let’s \\nimagine a fictional YouTube creator I’ll call Codysseus. Codys -\\nseus is a twenty-five-year-old software developer who travels \\naround North America in his van conversion, accompanied by \\nhis pet cat Clickbait.\\nWhen Codysseus arrives at a new destination, he usually ends \\nup staying in the most unique Airbnb he can find. When no \\nrentals are available, he just stays in his van. Since remote \\ncomputer work is not particularly cinematic, Codysseus also \\nspends a fair amount of time exploring his latest habitat in \\nsearch of material he can use in the weekly episodes he posts to \\nYouTube. Sometimes he takes odd jobs in the hope of creating \\nmore fodder for his channel. Sometimes he gives seminars to \\nthe locals on how to approximate his digital nomad life.\\nIn the early days of his channel, Codysseus was vigilant about \\nanswering every viewer comment within twenty-four hours. He \\nquickly learned that maintaining this high level of responsive-\\nness turned one-time viewers into repeat viewers, and repeat \\nviewers into subscribers. But now that he has 150,000 sub-\\nscribers and a new video can get upwards of 1000 comments, \\nhe has to leave more and more questions unanswered.\\n106Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nNot surprisingly, given his work as a software developer, Codys -\\nseus starts thinking about how AI could help him out. Initially, \\nhis focus is on how he might automate replies to the comments \\nhis viewers leave him on YouTube. At a certain point, however, \\nhe realizes that creating a full-blown chatbot of himself would \\nbe even more compelling. It would give his fans an ongoing, \\nin-depth way to interact with him. It might become a source of \\nreal insights about what his fans like best about his content and \\nhis persona. It could even generate revenues.\\nHow possible is it for someone like Codysseus to create their \\nown LLM chatbot now?\\nHere’s what GPT-4 replied when I put the question to it:\\nReid: Assume that GPT-4 is publicly accessible, afford-\\nable, and scalable, and that it has significantly improved \\non GPT-3’s capabilities in terms of generalization, coher -\\nence, and diversity. If all this is true, would a YouTube \\ncreator named Codysseus, with a catalog of transcripts \\nfrom more than a hundred fifteen-minute episodes, \\nplus 20,000+ words of blog archives, plus 2000+ replies \\nto viewer comments, plus 500+ Reddit posts be able to \\nuse this data to effectively create a fine-tuned version of \\nGPT-4 that approximates his speech patterns, sensibil-\\nities and values, sense of humor, guiding interests and \\naspirations, and generally conveys his personality?\\nGPT-4:  Possible answer: Yes, a YouTube creator named \\nCodysseus would likely be able to use this data to effec -\\ntively create a fine-tuned version of GPT-4 that approx -\\nimates his speech patterns, sensibilities and values, \\nsense of humor, guiding interests and aspirations, and \\ngenerally conveys his personality. Assuming that GPT-4 \\nis publicly accessible, affordable, and scalable, and that \\nit has significantly improved on GPT-3’s capabilities, \\n107Social Media\\nCodysseus could leverage the large and diverse corpus \\nof his own written and spoken content to train a custom \\nmodel that captures his unique voice and style. He could \\nalso use additional data sources, such as feedback from \\nhis audience, social media interactions, and relevant top -\\nics and trends, to further refine and update his model. \\nBy fine-tuning GPT-4 on his own data, Codysseus could \\npotentially generate new content that is consistent, \\ncoherent, and creative, and that reflects his personality \\nand preferences. He could also use his model to interact \\nwith his fans, answer questions, and provide commen-\\ntary on various issues. However, Codysseus would also \\nneed to be careful and ethical in using his model, and \\nensure that he discloses and acknowledges the use of \\nGPT-4 to his viewers and followers. He would also need \\nto monitor and evaluate his model’s outputs, and correct \\nany errors, biases, or inaccuracies that might arise. More -\\nover, he would need to respect the intellectual property \\nand privacy rights of others, and avoid plagiarizing or \\nmisrepresenting any sources or information. Finally, he \\nwould need to maintain his own authenticity and integ-\\nrity, and not rely solely on his model to express himself or \\nengage with his community.\\nIn short, it’s quite possible that someone like Codysseus could \\ndo this already.\\nIt would take him some time and effort to arrange all his source \\ndata—the YouTube transcripts, blog posts, etc.—into the format \\nthat the fine-tuning process requires. At that point, though, \\nhe’d be able to use the resources OpenAI provides at extremely \\nlow cost. (In Codysseus’ hypothetical case, OpenAI would prob-\\nably charge him around $30 for its fine-tuning process.)\\n108Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nAs usual, GPT-4 emphasizes the same themes I’ve been empha-\\nsizing throughout this travelog: the value of transparency, \\nongoing human oversight, and complementarity. If Codysseus \\nwere open about his chatbot usage, and presented this digital \\nentity transparently as an extension of himself (instead of \\ntrying to pass it off as the real him), his opportunities would \\nincrease accordingly.\\nHe might, for example, ultimately create multiple fine-tuned \\nmodels of himself. One might focus primarily on coding \\ninstruction. Another might offer advice specifically on digital \\nnomadism. Perhaps he’d even create a chatbot—make that a \\ncatbot —to embody Clickbait.\\nSome of these iterations might be available only to paying sub-\\nscribers. Others might be underwritten by sponsors whose \\nproducts and services the chatbot occasionally mentions. All \\nwould potentially increase the value of the human Codysseus \\nas an advertising spokesperson, business consultant, or events \\nspeaker, to name just a few possibilities, just as books, pod -\\ncasts, and other media artifacts already perform this function.\\nSocial media AI: the next generations\\nWhen YouTube launched in 2005, no one was quick to predict \\nthat it would evolve into one of the world’s greatest educational \\nand reference resources. No one foresaw that it was about to \\nturn cats into millionaires. No one was anticipating the rapid \\ngrowth and mainstreaming of content genres like reaction \\nvideos, makeup videos, unboxing videos, ASMR videos, and so \\nmany others.\\n109Social Media\\nInstead, thousands of innovative creators equipped with pow -\\nerful new tools and capabilities simply started exploring their \\ncrazy ideas and passions—and sometimes magic happened.\\nThis cycle is about to repeat itself, this time with AI. So the \\nchatbot example I’ve focused on in this chapter is just one of \\ncountless possible paths forward. Those who truly crack the \\ncodes here will likely do so with ideas and approaches no one \\nhas yet to imagine. For them, an incredible future of creative \\nfulfillment and high impact awaits.\\n110TRANSFORMATION OF WORK\\nWhen I graduated from college in 1990, jobs like “web \\ndesigner,” “SEO strategist,” and “data scientist” didn’t exist.\\nWhen my co-founders and I launched LinkedIn thirteen years \\nlater in 2003, none of our users had jobs like “social media \\nmanager,” “TikTok influencer,” or “virtual reality architect.”\\nWith GPT-4 and other forms of AI, we’re going to see similar \\nimpacts on industry trends, overall work patterns, and career \\npaths. The companies, professions, and individuals who figure \\nout how to incorporate these new tools into their workflows \\nin the most innovative and productive ways will fare best. The \\nones that don’t adapt in strategic ways will struggle to maintain \\ntheir relevance and competitiveness in a changing marketplace.\\nIn my opinion, ignoring AI is like ignoring blogging in the late \\n1990s, or social media circa 2004, or mobile in 2007. Very \\nquickly, some degree of facility with these tools will be increas-\\ningly essential for all professionals, a primary driver for new \\nopportunities and new jobs. Developing skills and competen -\\ncies in it now will yield benefits for years to come.\\nIt’s also true that the changes AI will bring will have negative \\nimpacts as well as positive ones. Previous technology revolu-\\ntions disrupted specific subgroups, like the craftsmen whose \\n111Transformation of Work\\nproduction was replaced by factories—or, more recently, \\nfactory workers who lost their jobs to increased automation.\\nNow, knowledge workers are also facing these challenges. \\nWhile I strongly believe that these new AI tools will create new \\njobs and new industries, along with great economic benefits \\nand other quality-of-life gains, they will also eliminate some \\njobs, both blue- and white-collar.\\nIn light of this reality, policy makers and business leaders \\ncan take a number of steps to help facilitate this transition. \\nThis includes investing in training and retraining programs \\nto ensure that workers are equipped with the necessary skills \\nto take on new roles. It means creating safety nets for workers \\naffected by automation.\\nTo navigate this moment most effectively, though, we must \\nalso do so with an adaptive, forward-looking perspective. In \\nmy mind, that means embracing AI in the same spirit that we \\nonce embraced the Model T and the Apple II. In the past, it has \\nalways been breakthrough technologies that have created the \\njobs of the future—and I expect it to be no different this time.\\nThe transformation of careers\\nBack in 2012, Ben Casnocha and I published The Start-up of \\nYou, our book on modern career management. We felt that far \\ntoo often, the societal conversation about careers focused on \\nhow changes were making it difficult to follow the old model \\nof joining a company and working your way up the ladder \\nuntil you retired with a gold watch and a pension. People were \\nclinging to old lessons that no longer applied, and mourning \\ntheir loss.\\n112Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nA far better approach, we thought, was to adapt to the future \\nby learning new lessons that would apply in a world with much \\ngreater job mobility.\\nA decade later, we published the revised and updated edition \\nof The Startup of You (note the dropping of the hyphen) to \\nincorporate some of the major shifts that had occurred, from \\nthe massive increase in gig work to the effects of the COVID-\\n19 pandemic and the move to hybrid remote and in-person \\nworkplaces.\\nWe may well have to write a third edition to cover the rise of AI, \\nand if so, we probably won’t wait until 2032 to publish it. (Who \\nknows? By the time the third edition comes out, GPT-4 may be \\na full co-author.)\\nYes, changes may make it harder to follow the old career \\nmodels, but a much more productive path is to look forward \\nto how changes enable new opportunities. People need to ask \\nthemselves, “What could possibly go right?”\\nLet’s explore some of the possible themes here.\\nReid: How might individual professionals use AI to help \\nthem implement the key career management concepts \\nand recommendations found in the book The Startup of \\nYou by Reid Hoffman and Ben Casnocha? Please write \\nthe answer in the form of a bulleted list.\\nGPT-4:\\n- Analyze data about an individual’s skills, experiences, \\nand interests to identify career opportunities that align \\nwith their goals.\\n- Suggest networking strategies and develop personal-\\nized strategies for marketing their personal brand.\\n113Transformation of Work\\n- Recommend mentors and advisors that could help the \\nindividual advance their career.\\n- Identify risks and potential failure points before taking \\naction, allowing the individual to make better decisions.\\nI can see how tools like GPT-4 could help identify career oppor-\\ntunities, recommend mentors and advisors (though of course \\nconvincing the targets so identified to become a mentor or \\nadvisor is its own challenge), and identify potential risks and \\nfailure points. I can even see it suggesting specific network-\\ning strategies. But how would it develop a personalized strat-\\negy, for a personal brand, when such a thing is necessarily, \\nwell, personal?\\nReid: Please develop a set of personalized strategies for \\nauthor and venture capitalist Ben Casnocha to market \\nhis personal brand. This should include a summary of \\nBen’s current personal brand, how that brand could be \\nrefined and improved, and a set of specific actions that \\nBen should take to market his personal brand.\\nGPT-4:  Ben Casnocha’s current personal brand is that of \\nan accomplished author, venture capitalist, and tech-\\nnology enthusiast. He is well-known for his books The \\nAlliance, The Start-up of You, and Bold, and is a partner \\nat the venture capital firm Village Global. His brand \\ncould be improved by increasing his visibility in the tech-\\nnology industry and highlighting his specific expertise. \\nTo market his personal brand, Ben should consider the \\nfollowing strategies:\\n- Speak at technology conferences and industry events \\nto increase his visibility and establish himself as a \\nthought leader in the industry.\\n- Leverage his social media presence to promote his \\nbooks, articles, and speaking engagements.\\n114Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\n- Connect with top technology influencers to expand \\nhis network and build relationships with key industry \\nplayers.\\n- Launch a podcast or web series to engage with a larger \\naudience and share his knowledge and insights.\\n- Publish articles in industry magazines and websites to \\ndemonstrate his expertise and showcase his work.\\n- Participate in entrepreneurship competitions and \\nhackathons to increase his visibility and network with \\nother entrepreneurs.\\n- Create a personal website to showcase his work and \\nprovide an online hub for his audience.\\nOK. First of all, there’s a factual error. Bold is actually by \\nPeter Diamandis and Steven Kotler; Ben’s first book was My \\nStart-up Life.\\nMore importantly, GPT-4’s recommendations are as generic as \\ncan be. There is nothing personalized about any of that advice.\\nLet’s try asking a more general question.\\nReid: What are some of the most impactful ways that a \\nyoung professional can use AI to help her manage her \\ncareer, accelerate her career progression, and find more \\nmeaningful and fulfilling work in a future where the \\nbroad adoption of AI technologies and tools has already \\ntransformed how humans work?\\nGPT-4:\\n- Automated career planning: AI can help you make \\ninformed decisions about your career and provide per -\\nsonalized guidance for career development. You can use \\nAI algorithms to create a personalized plan for career \\nprogression and identify key steps to success.\\n115Transformation of Work\\n- Automated skills assessment: AI can help you assess \\nyour current skills and identify new skills that you need \\nto acquire in order to advance your career. This can \\nenable you to stay updated with the latest industry \\ntrends and develop the skills required to stay com-\\npetitive.\\n- Automated job matching: AI can help you find the \\nright job opportunities that best match your skills and \\nexperience. By leveraging AI algorithms, you can get \\npersonalized recommendations for job postings that are \\nmost suitable for you.\\n- Automated resume optimization: AI can help you \\ncreate the perfect resume that highlights your skills and \\nexperience. You can use AI algorithms to identify the \\nbest combination of words and phrases to make your \\nresume stand out.\\n- Automated job interview preparation: AI can help you \\nprepare for job interviews by providing personalized \\nguidance. You can use AI algorithms to analyze the job \\ndescription and identify the questions that you will likely \\nbe asked during the interview.\\nIt feels like GPT-4 is having the terms “automated” and \\n“algorithms” do a lot of work there. Nonetheless, the advice \\nseems sound.\\nMy personal “human intelligence” take is that AI can serve as \\nyour co-captain as you steer the ship of your career. The core \\ninsight of The Startup of You is that your career is like a startup, \\nand you are its CEO. Being a startup CEO is a lonely and stress -\\nful job, full of uncertainty and paralyzing dilemmas. One way \\nto make the job a bit more manageable is to build a personal \\nboard of advisors who can help and support you, but even that \\napproach has its limitations.\\n116Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nYour board members, being human, won’t always be avail -\\nable to talk. GPT-4 and other such AI tools can serve as an \\nAI advisor, helping you analyze any situation and generate \\noptions, and will do so on-demand, at any time, in a matter \\nof seconds. GPT-4’s suggestions won’t always be immediately \\nhelpful, but they will provide something to react to and build \\non, which is better than being stuck with a blank page.\\nThe transformation of management\\nShortly after Ben and I published The Startup of You, we real-\\nized that creating a new framework for how individual profes -\\nsionals should approach their careers also created the need \\nfor a new framework for how employers and managers should \\nwork with these newly empowered and entrepreneurial pro-\\nfessionals.\\nSo we asked our old friend Chris Yeh to explore those implica-\\ntions with us in a second book, The Alliance .\\nThat book’s thesis is that organizations and managers are using \\noutdated metaphors to think about the employment relation-\\nship. Many CEOs want to think of their employees as family, \\nbut family implies a permanent and virtually unbreakable \\nrelationship that just isn’t practical in the modern workplace. \\nOther leaders go too far in the other direction, conceiving of \\ntheir employees as purely free agents, making it nearly impos-\\nsible to build trust, loyalty, and long-term value.\\nThe better metaphor, we assert, is to think of employees as \\nallies—independent entities who come together to pursue an \\nimportant shared mission, complete with an explicit agree -\\nment about what constitutes success and how success makes \\n117Transformation of Work\\nthe business stronger and accelerates the employee’s career \\nprogression.\\nNow let’s bring in AI.\\nReid: How might organizations and managers use AI to \\nhelp them implement the key management concepts \\nand recommendations found in the 2014 book The Alli-\\nance  by Reid Hoffman, Ben Casnocha, and Chris Yeh? \\nPlease make sure you write about building an alliance \\nbetween employee and employer, defining a specific \\n“tour of duty” for the employee, which lays out a specific \\nmission that benefits both employer and employee, and \\nhow employers can establish and leverage a corporate \\nalumni network to stay in touch with former employees. \\nPlease write the answer in the form of a bulleted list.\\nGPT-4:\\n- AI can be used to help build strong relationships \\nbetween employers and employees by providing per -\\nsonalized, real-time feedback on performance and job \\nsatisfaction.\\n- AI can help organizations define specific “tours of duty” \\nfor employees, which lay out the specific mission that \\nboth employer and employee can benefit from.\\n- AI can help employers establish and leverage cor -\\nporate alumni networks to stay in touch with former \\nemployees and understand their motivations, skills, and \\nexperiences.\\n- AI can help organizations create a culture of trust and \\ncollaboration by providing employees with tailored \\nadvice and assistance as needed.\\n- AI can help organizations create a culture of transpar -\\nency and openness by providing employees with access \\n118Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nto up-to-date information about the company’s perfor -\\nmance and goals.\\n- AI can help organizations create a culture of learning \\nand continuous improvement by providing employees \\nwith personalized training and development oppor -\\ntunities.\\n- AI can help organizations establish a system of feed-\\nback and reward employees for their achievements, by \\nproviding employees with timely feedback and rec -\\nognition.\\nI like a lot of the ideas here, even if some lack an obvious connec-\\ntion with The Alliance  (for example, our book doesn’t discuss \\n“cultures of learning” or reward systems). The modern work-\\nplace is so busy that managers have fewer and fewer opportuni -\\nties to provide timely feedback to their direct reports, and vice \\nversa. The rise of remote and hybrid workplaces only exacer-\\nbates the problem. I’m excited that AI could help improve the \\nemployee experience by offering feedback and development \\nwhen they want it, rather than when their schedule happens to \\nline up with their manager’s.\\nDiving deeper . . .\\nReid: What are some of the ways AI can be used to \\nhelp build strong relationships between employers and \\nemployees by providing personalized, real-time feed-\\nback on performance and job satisfaction?\\nGPT-4:  AI can be used to . . .\\n- Provide employees with personalized advice and assis-\\ntance on specific tasks or projects.\\n119Transformation of Work\\n- Identify areas of improvement and provide tailored \\nguidance to employees on how to improve their per -\\nformance.\\n- Provide employees with up-to-date feedback on their \\nperformance and job satisfaction.\\n- Provide employees with timely recognition for their \\nachievements.\\n- Provide employees with tailored training and develop -\\nment opportunities.\\n- Analyze employee sentiment and provide employers \\nwith an understanding of employee engagement and \\njob satisfaction.\\nWhat strikes me is how we ask managers to do all of these \\nthings today with little to no support from technology (with the \\npossible exception of sentiment analysis). I’m still not sure how \\nAI will do all of these things, but if it does, it will be a huge boon \\nto managers.\\nReid: What are some of the ways AI can help organi-\\nzations define specific “tours of duty” for employees, \\nwhich lay out a specific mission that both employer and \\nemployee can benefit from?\\nGPT-4:  AI can be used to . . .\\n- Develop specific job descriptions and tasks, tailored to \\nthe employee’s skills and interests.\\n- Identify potential opportunities for employees to prog-\\nress and develop their skills.\\n- Provide employees with personalized guidance and \\nadvice on how to achieve their goals.\\n- Analyze employee performance and suggest areas to \\nfocus on and improve.\\n120Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\n- Provide employees with tailored goal-setting and prog-\\nress tracking tools.\\n- Provide employees with individualized feedback and \\nrecognition for their achievements.\\nIn The Startup of You and The Alliance , we lay out the case that \\nindividuals need to take control of their own career journey. \\nThis is undoubtedly true, but remains daunting. The promise \\nof AI is that it will help people with these meta tasks that exist \\nin parallel with explicit work assignments in order to help every \\nemployee, not just the most self-motivated and disciplined, \\noptimize their work performance and career progression.\\nReid: Write a story of around 400 words about a man-\\nager and employee in the year 2035 using AI to work \\ntogether to define a tour of duty for that employee, and \\nleveraging AI to help that employee achieve greater \\nproductivity and accelerated career development. Illus-\\ntrate the benefits to the company, the manager, and the \\nemployee of this approach.\\nGPT-4:  It was the year 2035, and the world of work had \\nchanged drastically. AI-powered automation and arti-\\nficial intelligence had transformed the way businesses \\noperated, leading to increased efficiency and pro -\\nductivity.\\nMark was the manager of a small tech company, and he \\nwas tasked with finding ways to increase the company’s \\noutput and profits. He knew he needed to find a way to \\nmotivate and engage his employees, but he was unsure \\nof how to do so.\\nOne day, he was discussing the issue with a colleague \\nwhen he was struck with an idea: what if he could use \\nAI to create a “tour of duty” for each employee? He \\ncould use AI to define specific goals and tasks for each \\n121Transformation of Work\\nemployee, as well as provide personalized guidance and \\nfeedback on their progress.\\nMark quickly set to work creating the system. He used \\nAI to define the tasks for each employee and provide \\ntailored feedback. He also used AI to analyze employee \\nsentiment and provide employees with timely recogni-\\ntion for their achievements.\\nThe results were immediate and impressive. Produc -\\ntivity skyrocketed as employees felt more motivated \\nand engaged in their work. Mark also noticed that the \\nmorale of his team had improved, as they felt more \\nempowered and valued.\\nBut the greatest benefit was to the company. With \\nAI-powered automation and guidance, Mark was able \\nto create a highly efficient and productive team. Profits \\nsoared, and the company’s reputation quickly spread.\\nMark had found the perfect solution to his problem. \\nWith AI-powered tours of duty, he had managed to \\ncreate an engaged and motivated workforce, while also \\nincreasing the company’s output and profits.\\nLove it!\\nNow let’s take a closer look at how some specific professions \\nthat are often identified as being endangered by AI might fare \\nin the future.\\nSales\\nDaniel Pink once wrote a #1 New York Times bestseller titled \\nTo Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth About Moving Others. \\nIt’s hard to picture a computer as a salesperson. How would \\nan AI build rapport by pointing out that you went to the same \\nschool as it, or sharing funny stories about raising its kids?\\n122Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nAt the same time, I can easily imagine how tools like GPT-4 \\ncould amplify human salespeople. Great salespeople take the \\ntime to deeply understand their potential buyer and, ideally, \\ncan customize a sales presentation to address their specific \\nneeds and make it easy for the buyer to visualize success.\\nLet’s see what GPT-4 thinks.\\nReid: How will the adoption of AI tools transform the \\nprofession of sales? Please address the key activities in \\nthe sales funnel, such as prospecting, qualifying leads, \\npresenting to the buyer, closing the deal, and helping \\ncustomers succeed.\\nGPT-4:  The adoption of AI tools has the potential to \\ntransform the profession of sales in a number of ways.\\nFirstly, AI-driven automation of sales processes can \\ndramatically increase sales productivity and efficiency. \\nAI-powered tools can help sales reps easily identify \\npotential leads, qualify them, and prioritize them based \\non the likelihood of successful sales outcomes. AI-driven \\nautomation can also help sales reps quickly create com-\\npelling presentations tailored to their customer’s needs \\nand preferences.\\nIn addition, AI-driven customer insights can be used \\nto better understand customer behaviors, needs, and \\npreferences to inform better sales strategies and tactics. \\nAI-driven customer insights can also be used to person-\\nalize sales pitches and better target customer segments.\\nFinally, AI-driven tools can help sales reps close deals \\nmore quickly and effectively by providing timely insights \\ninto customer sentiment and helping sales reps identify \\nthe best time to reach out and close the deal. AI-driven \\ntools can also help sales reps provide post-sale customer \\nsuccess by helping them anticipate customer needs and \\nproactively reach out with helpful solutions.\\n123Transformation of Work\\nThis resonates with my own experience. Analyzing and quali-\\nfying leads, understanding customer behavior and needs, per-\\nsonalizing sales pitches, staying on top of customer sentiment, \\nand proactively reaching out to customers after a deal is closed \\nare time-consuming. That’s why only the best, most dedicated \\nhuman sales professionals do a good job with them.\\nFor example, if I wanted to maximize my chances of making \\na sale, I would look up my buyer on LinkedIn and analyze her \\nprofile. I would also research her non-business social media \\nposts to understand her likes, dislikes, and passions. I would \\ntailor my sales presentation to reflect past projects she’s worked \\non, or might work on in the future. (One of my AI investments, \\nTome, is already making it easier to create great presentations!) \\nI would watch the news for events at her company that might \\naffect her buying decision. And, post-sale, I’d monitor how \\nshe was using my product so I could suggest ways to add more \\nvalue and solve other problems.\\nOf course, doing this for every customer is incredibly \\ntime-consuming.\\nToo many human salespeople prefer to simply “churn and \\nburn,” calling sales “a numbers game.” This is especially true \\nfor startups, where the product and market may not be mature \\nenough for a simple, repeatable sales process.\\nAI-amplified sales might offer the best of both worlds by doing \\nmuch of the hard work that many human sales professionals \\nskip, allowing the humans to focus instead on what AI can’t do, \\nlike building relationships with the buyer and reading emo-\\ntional cues during sales calls.\\nSo far, all good for salespeople. But is there a downside?\\n124Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nReid: How will the adoption of AI tools negatively impact \\nthe careers of human sales professionals?\\nGPT-4:  The adoption of AI tools is likely to have a sig-\\nnificant and direct negative impact on the careers of \\nhuman sales professionals. AI-driven automation of sales \\nprocesses will reduce the need for human sales reps to \\nperform certain tasks, such as prospecting and quali-\\nfying leads, creating presentations, and closing deals. \\nAI-driven automation is likely to lead to a reduction in \\nthe number of human sales reps required to perform \\nthese tasks.\\nIn addition, AI-driven customer insights will reduce the \\nneed for human sales reps to analyze customer data and \\ndevelop customer segmentation strategies. AI-driven \\ncustomer insights are likely to lead to fewer opportuni-\\nties for human sales reps to use their insights and exper -\\ntise to inform sales strategies.\\nFinally, AI-driven tools may make it easier for customers \\nto find solutions to their needs without the help of a \\nhuman sales rep. This could reduce the need for human \\nsales reps to provide customer service and lead to fewer \\nopportunities for sales reps to interact with customers \\nand make sales.\\nGPT-4 sure isn’t mincing words here. Today, many in enterprise \\nsales get their start as a Business Development Representative \\n(BDR). These early-career professionals “dial for dollars” with \\noutbound calls, emails, and yes, LinkedIn messages. While the \\nwork is tedious, it is still work, and those who excel at it often \\nwin promotion to full-fledged sales positions.\\nAI will make human BDRs more effective by providing them \\nwith personalized information on the prospects they call—but \\nthis increased productivity will likely decrease employment, \\n125Transformation of Work\\nbecause buyers only have so much money. This result is still \\nbetter for society as a whole, since bad sales calls are a waste \\nof every participant’s time, but it will reduce the overall level of \\nemployment in the profession.\\nI believe that the future will see the sales profession shrink as \\na whole. At the same time, the productivity of individual sales \\nprofessionals will increase, and likely their compensation as \\nwell. And the AI-driven increased quality of selling means that \\ncompanies that aggressively adopt these tools will beat any \\ncompetitors that don’t.\\nLaw\\nI have personal reasons for my interest in how AI will affect \\nlawyers. Both my parents practiced law, and from a young age, \\nI’ve had direct personal experience with the profession. I’m \\npowerfully curious how AI might change it.\\nReid: What are some ways in which AI may be better \\nsuited to handle some legal tasks than human attor -\\nneys? Which legal tasks are the most easily automated \\nusing AI? What are the legal tasks where AIs will likely \\noutperform human lawyers?\\nGPT-4:  AI is better suited for tasks that require large \\namounts of data and information to be analyzed and \\norganized quickly and accurately. AI can quickly search \\nthrough large data sets and identify patterns and trends, \\nas well as draw conclusions from the data. AI can also \\nautomate low-level legal tasks, such as document review \\nand contract review, which can be tedious and time con-\\nsuming for human lawyers. AI may also be able to pre -\\ndict the outcome of a legal case, given certain facts and \\nevidence. AI is also better suited for tasks that require \\nprecise, technical analysis, such as patent searches or \\nfinancial analysis.\\n126Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nI can see how AI could equal or exceed the work of human \\nclerks and paralegals for conducting patent searches, digging \\nthrough discovery data, or searching for red flags in long, \\nboring contracts. Leveraging AI might also be a good first step \\nbefore bringing in an (expensive) outside expert, or to make a \\nlawyer’s usage of such an expert more effective.\\nNow let’s look at the positive case.\\nReid: How might the adoption of AI in the practice of \\nlaw positively impact the career prospects of current \\nattorneys? What steps might those lawyers take to \\nenhance their careers by using AI in their work?\\nGPT-4:  The adoption of AI in the practice of law could \\npotentially lead to increased job opportunities for law -\\nyers, as AI technology can automate certain routine \\ntasks, freeing up lawyers’ time to focus on more com-\\nplex and challenging areas of law. Lawyers can also use \\nAI to enhance their understanding of the law by taking \\nadvantage of AI’s ability to quickly search through large \\namounts of data and information. Lawyers can also \\nutilize AI to better understand the legal implications of \\ncertain cases and to develop creative solutions to legal \\nissues. Lawyers can stay ahead of the curve by continu-\\nously learning about the latest advancements in AI tech-\\nnology and how it can be applied to the practice of law.\\nIn my personal experience, the actual practice of law is more \\nboring, tedious, and detail-obsessed than the typical television \\nprogram or movie makes it seem. There’s a lot less delivering \\neloquent speeches to a jury, and a lot more reading thousands \\nof pages of poorly written documents. AI would be terrible at \\nthe former, but is very good at the latter.\\n127Transformation of Work\\nWhile AI certainly has the potential to disrupt the way we cur-\\nrently handle low-level legal work, it also has the potential to \\nimprove the happiness of an often-unhappy profession. I’m \\nnot sure any human attorneys ever enjoy reading thousands of \\nnearly identical contracts, however well they are paid!\\nManagement consulting\\nThe tech industry is notoriously skeptical of management con-\\nsulting, but having worked with many smart, high-integrity \\nprofessionals at firms like McKinsey, I believe management \\nconsultants can play an important role in business (albeit rarely \\nat startups with fewer than one hundred employees.)\\nManagement consultants are often called upon to draw con-\\nclusions from large amounts of data, to benchmark and share \\nbest practices, and to create plans for starting and growing new \\nbusiness units. A lot of these tasks feel like they might be well-\\nsuited to AI.\\nLet’s test that intuition.\\nReid: What are some of the ways that AI could be used \\nto perform the important functions of management \\nconsulting?\\nGPT-4:\\n- AI could be used to help identify opportunities for \\nimprovement and cost savings in businesses by analyz -\\ning data sets and recommending strategies and tactics.\\n- AI could be used to help with forecasting and predic -\\ntive analysis to better anticipate market trends, cus-\\ntomer behavior, and other economic conditions.\\n- AI could be used to generate insights from customer \\nfeedback and employee surveys, allowing for more tar -\\ngeted and effective management consulting activities.\\n128Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\n- AI could be used to collect and analyze data on com-\\npetitors and industry trends, helping to identify areas for \\nimprovement and growth.\\n- AI could be used to automate and speed up the pro -\\ncess of crafting and implementing strategies, allowing \\nfor more efficient and effective management consulting.\\nGPT-4 puts a lot of emphasis on analyzing data and drawing \\nconclusions here, which seems logical—that’s what Bain and \\nBCG and their compadres do. But if AI is doing so much analy-\\nsis, what happens to the human consultants?\\nReid: How might the adoption of AI within the manage -\\nment consulting industry negatively impact the career \\nprospects of current consultants? Provide examples of \\nhow these changes will affect early-career analysts and \\nassociates, mid-career engagement managers, and \\nhigh-level executives such as McKinsey partners.\\nGPT-4:  The adoption of AI within the management \\nconsulting industry could have a negative impact on \\nthe career prospects of current consultants. Early-career \\nanalysts and associates may be the most affected, as AI \\ncan automate many of the tasks they are responsible for, \\nsuch as research, data analysis, and report writing. As AI \\nsystems become more sophisticated, these roles may \\nbecome redundant, leading to a decrease in job oppor -\\ntunities for these individuals.\\nMid-career engagement managers may also be affected \\nby the adoption of AI. AI systems may be able to auto -\\nmate the processes of creating and implementing strat -\\negies, making engagement managers’ roles less nec -\\nessary. They may also be replaced by AI systems in their \\nrole of providing insights and advice to clients, as AI sys-\\ntems become more capable of performing these tasks.\\n129Transformation of Work\\nEven high-level executives such as McKinsey partners \\nmay be affected by the adoption of AI. AI systems may \\nbe able to automate decision-making and strategy \\nimplementation, making the role of the partner less \\nessential. Additionally, AI systems may be able to gener -\\nate insights and advice for clients, reducing the need for \\npartners to provide their own expertise.\\nThese answers seem reasonable. A lot of the “grunt work” that \\nthe analysts and associates perform—which includes a lot of \\nweb searching and drafting PowerPoint slides—could be per-\\nformed by tools such as GPT-4 and Tome. And, to the extent \\nthat a client hires a management consulting firm to provide the \\nconventional wisdom on a topic, why not turn to AI to conduct \\na truly comprehensive review of the source data?\\nManagement consultants who are unable to add value beyond \\nthese standardized activities will suffer. A firm can’t pay young \\nanalysts and associates to “turn the crank” and then charge the \\nclient ten times their salary for their output. But management \\nconsultants who can take the time that AI frees up and focus \\ninstead on generating more unconventional insights could \\ndevote more of their time to this high-value activity and deliver \\neven better service to their clients with the help of AI.\\nOne potential issue is, if management consulting firms aren’t \\nhiring armies of bright young university and B-school gradu-\\nates to perform the basic tasks of management consulting, how \\nwill the next generation of partners learn their craft? Let’s see if \\nAI can solve the problem.\\nReid: In the future, how might management consulting \\nfirms use AI to help train and upskill entry-level analysts \\nand associates, if those young consultants aren’t get -\\n130Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nting the opportunity to learn their craft by performing \\nthe research and analysis tasks that have been taken \\nover by AI?\\nGPT-4:  Management consulting firms may use AI to \\nhelp train and upskill entry-level analysts and associates \\nin the future. AI systems can be used to simulate real-\\nworld scenarios and provide virtual coaching to young \\nconsultants, helping them to hone their skills and gain \\nexperience with the use of AI. Additionally, AI systems \\ncan be used to provide personalized learning plans for \\nyoung consultants, helping them to focus on the areas \\nwhere they need the most development.\\nFirms may also use AI to provide virtual mentorship pro -\\ngrams for entry-level analysts and associates. AI systems \\ncan be used to provide personalized advice and guid-\\nance to young consultants, helping them to gain the \\nskills and knowledge they need to succeed in their roles. \\nAdditionally, firms may use AI to facilitate the exchange \\nof knowledge and insights between experienced con-\\nsultants and entry-level analysts and associates, helping \\nthe young consultants to learn from their more experi-\\nenced colleagues.\\nI like the concept of using AI-powered simulations to help train \\nthe human professionals of the future. Many young profession -\\nals complain about not getting enough opportunities to learn \\nand the lack of mentorship. It may take some refinement, but \\nperhaps AI can help solve these all-too-common issues.\\nAs I reach this chapter’s end, it occurs to me that I can perhaps \\nsave myself some work right now. Let’s bring things to a con-\\nclusion with GPT-4’s help.\\nReid: Please write a 200-word conclusion to the [preced-\\ning] essay.\\n131Transformation of Work\\nGPT-4:\\nA common theme throughout this essay is that AI will \\nlikely disrupt some professions more than others, but \\nthat the potential for positive change is immense. In \\nsome cases, such as with sales, AI will likely lead to a \\nreduction in the overall number of jobs, but will also \\nenable the remaining professionals to become more \\nproductive and effective. In other cases, such as with law, \\nAI may lead to an overall improvement in the happiness \\nand satisfaction of the profession.\\nWhile it is important to be aware of the ways in which \\nAI may disrupt traditional career paths, it is also import -\\nant to remember that AI can create new opportunities \\nfor growth and advancement. As we move into a future \\nwhere AI tools are a core part of normal work processes, \\nit is essential for professionals to take advantage of \\nthe opportunities that AI presents in order to achieve \\ngreater productivity and more meaningful work.\\n132GPT-4 IN MY OWN WORK\\nIn the same way I expect GPT-4 and similar technologies to \\ntransform the world of work, I also expect them to transform \\nthe way I work. I’ve had the opportunity to experiment with \\nGPT-4 for a few months, and while I know I’m still on the steep \\npart of my learning curve, I believe I have enough experience to \\noffer some advice on how to use these tools.\\nWhen transformational technologies appear, most people are \\ntempted to plug them in as a substitute for an existing tech -\\nnology or technique. This seems sensible, since it minimizes \\nthe time and effort needed to start using the new tech, but this \\napproach is actually a trap: seldom is the new technology an \\nexact analogue for what came before.\\nWhen the internet first appeared, pioneering services like \\nYahoo! resembled online phone books. Directories were how \\nwe found things, so the seemingly logical first step was to create \\nan online directory. We discovered over time that the better \\napproach was to create a new tool: the search engine.\\nWe’re still at the online-phone-book stage of LLMs. It’s unlikely \\nto be a direct replacement for search engines across many of \\ntheir use cases, but it will offer people new ways to gather rele -\\nvant and useful information.\\n133GPT-4 In My Own Work\\nHere are three key principles I’ve found useful in my own \\nattempts to use GPT-4 in my work.\\nPrinciple 1: Treat GPT-4 like an undergrad research assistant, \\nnot an omniscient oracle.\\nIf you’ve ever worked with an undergraduate research assistant \\n(or if you were one in college), you know that a helper like that \\nis both powerful and limited in specific ways.\\nIn some ways, GPT-4 far exceeds any human research assis-\\ntant: it has access to an incredibly broad base of knowledge, \\nit is blindingly fast, and it’s available whenever you need it (as \\nopposed to needing to study for midterms).\\nIt also has many of the other drawbacks of a human research \\nassistant: it’s not an expert, its grasp of any particular subject is \\nfairly shallow, and it gets things wrong. In fact, when it’s wrong, \\nit’s worse than a human research assistant, since a human will \\noften have the good sense to warn you when he or she isn’t \\ncertain about the quality of their output.\\nDespite these drawbacks, the power of giving everyone access \\nto nearly instantaneous, on-demand research help is truly \\nremarkable. Just make sure you cross-check results with deeper \\nsources and actual human experts.\\nPrinciple 2: Think of yourself as a director, not a carpenter.\\nWhen we work with tools, we are trained to think of them as \\nan extension of us. A carpenter swings a hammer and gets one \\nstep closer to completing a house. He or she knows what the \\nhammer will do each time it swings, and works accordingly.\\n134Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nThis metaphor breaks down when it comes to tools like GPT-4. \\nRather than manipulating a physical tool to generate a predict -\\nable and planned result, using GPT-4 is like directing a scene \\nfrom a movie.\\nAs the director, you’re working with an actor to elicit the best \\nperformance. You’re not telling them, “Bend your neck fifteen \\ndegrees, and then after 2.5 seconds, look at the person across \\nfrom you.” Instead, you’re asking them to make the audience \\nfeel a certain way: “Convince us you’re in love.”\\nGPT-4 isn’t a human actor, but the process of directing it is \\nsimilar. You have to coax out your desired result, and you may \\nneed to try many variations on a prompt in the same way a \\ndirector might need to film multiple takes of the same scene. \\nIt’s ultimately a collaborative process.\\nPrinciple 3: Just try it!\\nIn most of our work, we’re taught to plan in advance and avoid \\nmaking mistakes. That’s because implementing a plan is costly \\nin terms of time and other resources—there’s a reason a car-\\npenter’s adage is to measure twice and cut once.\\nBut what if implementing a plan was cheaper and faster than \\nthinking about it?\\nThat’s the confounding paradox of GPT-4 and LLMs. In far \\nless time than it takes to debate a plan, GPT-4 can simply gen-\\nerate a complete response for you to review. If you don’t like \\nthe response, you can throw it away and generate another one, \\nor you might just generate three variations to give you more \\npotential choices.\\n135GPT-4 In My Own Work\\nFor example, I’ve already adopted the practice of trying out \\nsome simple prompts any time I have a significant piece of \\nwork in front of me.\\nLike sitting down to write this chapter.\\nReid: What are some of the ways that investor, author, \\nand philanthropist Reid Hoffman might use LLMs to be \\nfaster, more efficient, and more effective at his work?\\nGPT-4:\\n- Automated research: LLMs can be used to search for \\nand find relevant information quickly and accurately. \\nHoffman could use this technology to quickly locate \\nresearch and data that would be useful for his invest -\\nments and philanthropic efforts.\\n- Automated content creation: LLMs can be used to cre -\\nate content such as articles and reports, saving Hoffman \\ntime and effort on research and writing.\\n- Automated analysis: LLMs can be used to analyze large \\namounts of data quickly and accurately, allowing Hoff -\\nman to make better and faster decisions.\\n- Automated communication: LLMs can be used to auto -\\nmate communication tasks such as answering emails \\nand scheduling meetings, freeing up Hoffman’s time for \\nmore important tasks.\\n- Automated investment decisions: LLMs can be used to \\nmake investment decisions based on complex data and \\nalgorithms, allowing Hoffman to make more informed \\ndecisions quickly.\\nAs usual, I think GPT-4 provides some instant food for thought.\\nResearch and analysis is definitely a good use of GPT-4, as it \\nliterally knows most of the internet circa 2021. Its knowledge \\n136Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nis far more comprehensive than any human’s, and future tools \\nwill likely be even more comprehensive.\\nAutomated content creation is interesting as a way of creat-\\ning instant first drafts, but I’m skeptical of claims that it can \\nbe used without human intervention for important writing—at \\nleast for my work. I would want to review and refine any arti-\\ncles or reports it produced, though this could still accelerate my \\nthroughput considerably.\\nI’m a bit more skeptical about the remaining suggestions, like \\nautomating my communications. People email me looking for \\ndecisions and introductions, and I’m not quite ready to let the \\nAI take over those functions just yet.\\nAs for making investment decisions, I think AI could help me \\nmake more informed investment decisions quickly by prompt-\\ning thoughts and helping me consider all the potential data \\npoints, but labeling this process an “automated investment \\ndecision” seems like a stretch.\\nDespite these minor objections, GPT-4 helped me tackle this \\nchapter by generating a reasonable taxonomy of my work, with \\npointers to where I might dive deeper. Since we’ve already spent \\na chapter on the transformation of work in the business world, \\nlet’s focus on my work as a writer/creator and philanthropist.\\nHow will AI transform these non-business worlds?\\nMy writing\\nThose who follow my career closely know that I didn’t set out to \\nbe an entrepreneur. When I graduated from Stanford, my plan \\nwas to become a professor. I wanted to have a positive impact \\non society, and I thought the best way to do this was to pursue \\n137GPT-4 In My Own Work\\nan academic career where I could think deeply and influence \\nothers with my writing.\\nIt only took a few months in graduate school to realize that, in \\norder to become a successful academic, I would need to focus \\nso intently on a highly specialized topic that anything I wrote \\nwould be read by an audience of—at best—a few dozen fellow \\nacademics, with little influence on the practical workings of \\nsociety. So I decided that I should focus instead on business.\\nI never wavered in my desire to think deeply about issues and \\ninfluence others. As fate would have it, my business success \\nhelped create an environment in which I have been able to \\nreturn to a variation on my original plan. Thanks to social media \\ncompanies like LinkedIn, Facebook, and Medium, the internet \\nhas become the world’s “town square”—except this town square \\ncan reach billions. And, thanks to my success as an entrepre -\\nneur and investor, I’ve earned enough credibility to build an \\naudience for my ideas through articles, books, and podcasts.\\nLet’s see if I can use GPT-4 to create a piece of “Reid Hoffman” \\nwriting that I think would have real-life value.\\nReid: Please write an essay of no less than 400 words, \\nin the style of Reid Hoffman, using specific examples \\nof real actions taken by specific companies and entre -\\npreneurs in the region, explaining how the core idea of \\nBlitzscaling—which is to prioritize speed over efficiency \\nto win a valuable winner-take-most market—works dif -\\nferently in sub-Saharan Africa, and what entrepreneurs \\nin that region need to know to Blitzscale successfully.\\nGPT-4 (edited for length): The concept of Blitzscaling is \\na relatively new business strategy that is being adopted \\nby many startups and companies around the world. \\nThis strategy is based on the idea of prioritizing speed \\n138Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nover efficiency when it comes to gaining a competitive \\nedge in a winner-take-most market. While this strategy \\ncan be effective in many contexts, it can be particularly \\nuseful in sub-Saharan Africa, where the business climate \\nis rapidly changing. In this region, entrepreneurs need \\nto be aware of the unique challenges and opportunities \\nthat come with Blitzscaling, and understand how to \\nimplement this strategy in a way that is tailored to their \\nspecific market.\\nOne of the biggest advantages of Blitzscaling for entre -\\npreneurs in sub-Saharan Africa is the ability to quickly \\ngain a foothold in rapidly changing markets. This region \\nis characterized by high levels of economic volatility, \\nmaking it difficult for companies to establish them-\\nselves in a short period of time. However, the Blitzs-\\ncaling approach enables companies to rapidly expand \\ntheir market share and gain a competitive edge over \\nslower-moving rivals. In order to successfully Blitzscale, \\nentrepreneurs in this region need to be willing to take \\ncalculated risks and move quickly.\\nFor example, Kenyan startup M-Kopa Solar successfully \\nutilized the Blitzscaling approach to become a market \\nleader in solar energy. By quickly recognizing the poten-\\ntial of this new technology and leveraging mobile pay -\\nment platforms, M-Kopa was able to rapidly scale their \\nbusiness and capture a significant portion of the market. \\nIn addition, the company was able to quickly adapt to \\nchanging customer needs by introducing new payment \\noptions and services.\\nIn addition to its advantages, Blitzscaling can also pres-\\nent certain risks for entrepreneurs in sub-Saharan Africa. \\nFor example, many of the region’s markets are marked \\nby high levels of competition, which can make it diffi-\\ncult for companies to maintain their market share in the \\nlong term. Furthermore, Blitzscaling can lead to a loss of \\n139GPT-4 In My Own Work\\nfocus on the customer, which can result in a lack of cus-\\ntomer loyalty and an inability to retain customers in the \\nlong term. As such, entrepreneurs in this region must be \\naware of these risks and ensure that they have a plan in \\nplace to address them.\\nIn order to successfully Blitzscale in sub-Saharan Africa, \\nentrepreneurs must be willing to take calculated risks \\nand move quickly. This means having a deep under -\\nstanding of the region’s markets and the competitive \\nlandscape. Furthermore, entrepreneurs should be \\nwilling to invest in the latest technologies and platforms \\nto gain an edge over their rivals. Finally, entrepreneurs \\nmust be prepared to adjust their strategies quickly in \\norder to respond to changing market trends and cus-\\ntomer demands.\\nThe response takes the actual definition of Blitzscaling into \\naccount, and the inclusion of the M-Kopa story is a real val-\\nue-add, since I’d never heard of the company before. On the \\nother hand, some of the advice is generic and unrelated to \\nBlitzscaling, like the repeated advice to invest in the latest \\ntechnologies and platforms, and adapting quickly to changing \\nmarket trends.\\nLet me drill down on GPT-4’s value as a research assistant.\\nReid: Please provide no less than five specific examples \\nof real actions taken by specific companies and entre -\\npreneurs in sub-Saharan Africa that explain how the \\ncore idea of Blitzscaling, which is to prioritize speed over \\nefficiency to win a valuable winner-take-most market,6 \\ncan be applied in that region.\\n6  Note that I’ve learned to write GPT-4 prompts with a degree of \\nspecificity I would seldom have to use with a human assistant. This is of \\ncourse an error-management strategy, and it often works pretty well. \\n140Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nGPT-4:\\n- Kenyan startup M-Kopa Solar leveraged the Blitzscaling \\napproach to become a market leader in solar energy. By \\nquickly recognizing the potential of this new technology \\nand leveraging mobile payment platforms, M-Kopa was \\nable to rapidly scale their business and capture a signifi-\\ncant portion of the market.\\n- South African company Naspers utilized Blitzscaling to \\nbecome a major player in the tech sector. Naspers was \\nable to quickly identify emerging trends in the tech sec -\\ntor and invest in companies that were well positioned to \\nsucceed.\\n- Nigerian e-commerce platform Jumia leveraged Blitzs-\\ncaling to capture a large share of the online retail mar -\\nket. By quickly adapting to changing customer needs, \\nJumia was able to scale their business and gain a com-\\npetitive edge over their rivals.\\n- Ghanaian startup Hubtel used Blitzscaling to become \\na leader in mobile payments. By quickly recognizing the \\npotential of mobile payment platforms and investing \\nheavily in the technology, Hubtel was able to capture a \\nlarge portion of the market.\\n- Kenyan healthcare provider E-Health Africa utilized \\nBlitzscaling to become a major player in the health sec -\\ntor. By quickly adopting new technologies and leverag-\\ning existing infrastructure, E-Health Africa was able to \\nscale their services and gain a competitive edge over \\ntheir rivals.\\nWhile I was aware of Naspers and Jumia, M-Kopa, Hubtel, \\nand E-Health Africa (which I believe is actually eHealth Africa) \\nwere all new to me.\\n141GPT-4 In My Own Work\\nReid: Write an essay of no less than 200 words that \\nexplains using specific examples how the Kenyan \\nstartup M-Kopa successfully applied the core ideas \\nof Blitzscaling to their business, including prioritizing \\nspeed over efficiency to win a valuable winner-take-\\nmost market.\\nGPT-4:  The Kenyan startup M-Kopa successfully applied \\nthe core ideas of Blitzscaling to their business in order \\nto win a valuable winner-take-most market. The com-\\npany was able to quickly recognize the potential of \\nsolar energy and leverage mobile payment platforms \\nto rapidly scale their business and capture a significant \\nportion of the market.\\nM-Kopa was able to quickly capitalize on the rapidly \\nchanging market dynamics in the region by introducing \\ninnovative payment plans and services. For example, the \\ncompany introduced a “pay-as-you-go” system, which \\nallowed customers to pay for solar energy in install-\\nments. This new system enabled customers to access \\nsolar energy at an affordable cost and enabled M-Kopa \\nto rapidly scale their business.\\nIn addition, M-Kopa was able to quickly adapt to chang-\\ning customer needs by introducing new payment \\noptions and services. The company was able to leverage \\nexisting infrastructure, such as mobile money platforms, \\nto enable customers to pay for solar energy using their \\nphones. This enabled M-Kopa to capture a large share of \\nthe market, as customers preferred the convenience of \\nmobile payments.\\nFurthermore, M-Kopa was able to leverage the latest \\ntechnologies to gain a competitive edge over their rivals. \\nFor example, the company was one of the first to adopt \\nthe use of artificial intelligence to predict customer \\nneeds and improve customer service. This enabled \\n142Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nM-Kopa to anticipate customer needs and take advan-\\ntage of market opportunities before their competitors.\\nIn conclusion, M-Kopa was able to successfully apply \\nthe core ideas of Blitzscaling in order to win a valuable \\nwinner-take-most market. The company was able to \\nquickly recognize the potential of solar energy and \\nleverage mobile payment platforms to rapidly scale their \\nbusiness. In addition, M-Kopa was able to quickly adapt \\nto changing customer needs and leverage the latest \\ntechnologies to gain a competitive edge over their rivals.\\nThis is the most useful response yet, full of detail. But it still \\nneeds to be fact-checked—for example, a cursory web search \\nfailed to turn up any articles on M-Kopa’s use of AI in cus-\\ntomer service.\\nAs some readers may know, I also host a podcast, Masters \\nof Scale , about strategies that helped startups grow into \\nglobal brands and the mindsets of growth that keep leaders \\nin the game.\\nLet’s see how GPT-4 might have helped me and my producers \\nprepare for an actual Masters of Scale  guest: Paul English, the \\nco-founder of travel search engine Kayak.\\nReid: Prepare a list of questions for Reid Hoffman, the \\nhost of the Masters of Scale podcast, to ask his guest, \\nPaul English, the co-founder of travel search engine \\nKayak. These should include questions that highlight the \\nimportance of recruiting and elicit some of Paul’s hard-\\nwon lessons on hiring.\\nGPT-4:\\n- What was the most important lesson you learned \\nabout recruitment during your time as co-founder \\nof Kayak?\\n143GPT-4 In My Own Work\\n- How did you keep recruiting a priority when develop -\\ning Kayak?\\n- What strategies did you use to attract top talent?\\n- What do you think is the most important factor in hir -\\ning the right people?\\n- What tips do you have for other entrepreneurs on \\nbuilding a strong team?\\n- How did you go about creating a healthy company \\nculture at Kayak?\\n- What methods did you use to ensure you hired the \\nright people for the right roles?\\n- How have you seen recruiting change over the years?\\n- In what ways did you approach recruiting differently \\nwhen Kayak was a startup compared to when it was an \\nestablished company?\\n- What advice do you have for entrepreneurs on keeping \\nrecruiting costs in check?\\nNice set of questions! The fact that some are fairly generic is \\nOK, because the goal of these questions is to give Paul a chance \\nto shine as a storyteller and teacher.\\nPerhaps we can use GPT-4 to help us meet this goal in a dif-\\nferent way.\\nReid: Please summarize at least three of the most \\nfamous and/or interesting stories about Paul English, the \\nco-founder of travel search engine Kayak, and his work \\nas an entrepreneur.\\nGPT-4:\\n- Paul English co-founded Kayak in 2004, and within \\nsix years it had become the second-largest travel site in \\nthe world. He famously kept the company’s costs low by \\n144Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nusing open-source technology and hiring engineers who \\nwere willing to work for equity rather than a salary.\\n- English was a passionate advocate for customer expe -\\nrience, and he was known for personally answering cus-\\ntomer emails himself. He was also known for his innova-\\ntive approach to recruiting, which included creating an \\nin-house incubator and relying heavily on referrals.\\n- English was a serial entrepreneur, having co-founded \\nseveral other companies before Kayak, including the \\nblogging platform, TripAdvisor. He was also known for \\nhis philanthropic efforts, having donated millions of dol-\\nlars to a variety of causes.\\nThese are some good stories, and they include the most famous \\nof all, which is Paul’s practice of personally handling cus-\\ntomer service. But as we’ve seen earlier, you have  to fact-check \\nGPT-4’s assertions. Paul did not found TripAdvisor (which \\nisn’t a blogging platform), and I believe the in-house incuba-\\ntor GPT-4 mentions is actually Blade, a separate incubator Paul \\nco-founded after Kayak had been acquired by Priceline.\\nDespite these issues, I still believe that the increased speed \\nLLMs can bring to the podcasting process will help boost our \\nproductivity.\\nPhilanthropy\\nI believe in the core principle of “Spider-Man Ethics”: with \\ngreat power comes great responsibility. Because my success \\nin business has granted me power and resources, I feel a deep \\nresponsibility to use these, along with my skills and experience, \\nto have a positive impact.\\nAs I have with the tech startup world, I have taken a network \\napproach to philanthropy. My goal isn’t to write checks and \\n145GPT-4 In My Own Work\\nchisel my name onto marble buildings; it’s to enable and \\namplify networks of people who are changing the world for \\nthe better.\\nI believe that, just as AI can amplify individual human efforts, \\nit can also amplify network impact, accelerating the progress of \\nmany of the organizations I support. Let’s look at a few exam-\\nples to get a sense of how AI will transform philanthropy.\\nEndeavor\\nEndeavor tries to build thriving entrepreneurial ecosystems in \\nemerging and underserved markets around the world. It’s an \\nincredible network of, by, and for high-impact entrepreneurs, \\nand I’m proud that Linda Rottenberg asked me to serve as a \\nboard member and the chairman of Endeavor Catalyst, Endeav-\\nor’s co-investment fund. We’ve affected thousands of entrepre -\\nneurs around the world.\\nReid: What are the ways that entrepreneurship commu-\\nnity Endeavor Global and its portfolio companies can use \\nLLMs to more rapidly and efficiently build thriving entre -\\npreneurial ecosystems in emerging and underserved \\nmarkets around the world?\\nGPT-4:\\n- Generate new ideas and strategies for advancing entre -\\npreneurial ecosystems: LLMs can be used to identify new \\nopportunities, models, and strategies for accelerating \\nthe growth of local ecosystems. AI can help identify \\npotential partnerships, sources of funding, new policy \\ninitiatives, and other resources that can be leveraged to \\nsupport entrepreneurs.\\n- Generate new and innovative products and services: \\nLLMs can help Endeavor Global and its portfolio compa-\\nnies create and launch new products and services that \\n146Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nare tailored to the needs of entrepreneurs in emerging \\nand underserved markets. AI can analyze data from \\nthese markets to identify gaps in the market and recom-\\nmend new products and services that can be offered to \\nfill those gaps.\\n- Automate data analysis and reporting: LLMs can help \\nautomate the process of collecting and analyzing data \\nfrom local entrepreneurial ecosystems. This can help \\nEndeavor Global and its portfolio companies to quickly \\nassess the health of a given market and identify trends \\nthat can be used to inform decisions and strategies.\\n- Streamline operational processes: LLMs can be used \\nto streamline operational processes, such as customer \\nonboarding, customer service, and other administrative \\ntasks. This can help Endeavor Global and its portfolio \\ncompanies to reduce costs and improve efficiency.\\nGPT-4’s suggestions seem to fall into two general categories. \\nFirst, AI can gather market data and help generate ideas. This \\ncan provide humans with rapid suggestions to stimulate their \\ncreativity and help ideation be more comprehensive by pointing \\nout possibilities that might otherwise be overlooked. Second, AI \\ncan help automate and streamline routine operations, freeing \\nup humans to focus on more creative tasks.\\nFor Endeavor, the latter category will likely be the most import-\\nant in the near future. For example, Endeavor puts a lot of \\neffort into supporting its companies. Endeavor staff could use \\nAI to translate English-language startup content into its entre-\\npreneurs’ native languages (while keeping a fluent human in \\nthe loop to sanity-check the results).\\nAnother form of support is connecting new startups with other \\ncompanies in the Endeavor network. AI could instantly suggest \\n147GPT-4 In My Own Work\\npotential customers and partners from the network. Even if \\nonly a small fraction of the suggestions were useful, there’s \\nstill huge value there—and it’s not something you could do \\nwith Google.\\nFor all of these activities, humans will remain in the pilot’s \\nchair, but AI can be a helpful co-pilot. Eventually, we won’t \\neven comment on entrepreneurs who operate with AI—they \\nwill simply be entrepreneurs.\\nThere is an additional area GPT-4 didn’t mention where AI will \\nbe a big help to entrepreneurs: as a storytelling tool.\\nEvery entrepreneur needs to tell a compelling story about \\nhow their startup will produce a better future. The more real \\nand concrete this possible future seems to potential inves-\\ntors, employees, buyers, and collaborators, the more likely the \\nstartup will be to attract the capital, people, customers, and \\npartners it needs to succeed.\\nPreviously, entrepreneurs were often limited by their skills as a \\nwriter and artist, but with tools like GPT-4 and Tome (a Grey-\\nlock investment), AI can help them write and illustrate their \\nideas, allowing the best ideas to win. They might still want a \\nhuman writer or designer to improve their presentations, but \\nstarting will be much easier and faster.\\nI’ll be discussing this tension at greater length at Endeavor Cat-\\nalyst in May.\\nOpportunity@Work\\nOne of the things that nearly every economist agrees upon is \\nthat one of the best economic investments that anyone can \\nmake is to earn a bachelor’s degree. Beyond valuing college \\n148Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\ndegrees, it has unfortunately become far too common to pre-\\nemptively exclude anyone without a bachelors’ degree from \\nconsideration of a vast range of jobs, even ones they have the \\nskills to do well.\\nThat’s not fair to millions of job seekers and harms employ -\\ners who miss skilled talent. It’s bad for our economy and \\nsociety. The opportunity to attend, fund, and complete college \\nis unevenly distributed. Geography, poverty, family obliga-\\ntions, conflicts between class and work schedules, and many \\nother factors prevent many ambitious and capable people \\nfrom getting a college degree. Those affected tend to be dis-\\nproportionately from Black and Hispanic communities, not to \\nmention rural Americans and military veterans of all racial and \\nethnic backgrounds.\\nOpportunity@Work addresses this unfairness and underval-\\nued talent by providing the business case, visualized skills data, \\nand tools to “tear the paper ceiling” so “if you can do the job, \\nyou can get the job.” It helps connect networks of technology \\nemployers with the 50 percent of U.S. workers who are skilled \\nthrough alternative routes (STARs) like community college, \\nworkforce training, bootcamps, certificate programs, mili-\\ntary service or learning in frontline jobs that are low-paid, but \\nare not low-skilled. It also helps those “routes,” pathways, or \\nprograms be discovered by employers whose skilled technical \\nworkforce needs match their learners’ skills.\\nLet’s see if AI can help Opportunity@Work with its important \\nand worthy mission.\\nReid: How can Opportunity@Work leverage AI to help \\nmore technology industry employers hire more workers \\n149GPT-4 In My Own Work\\nwho lack a college degree but are skilled through alter -\\nnative routes?\\nGPT-4:  AI can help Opportunity@Work by leveraging \\ndata from job postings, resumes, and other hiring mate -\\nrials to identify potential candidates who lack a college \\ndegree but have the skills and experience necessary \\nfor a given job. AI can then analyze the collected data \\nto provide insights into the most desirable skills and \\nqualifications employers are seeking in a given job, mak -\\ning it easier for employers to identify and source talent \\nfrom alternative pathways. AI can also help employers \\nassess the qualifications of potential candidates and \\nmake more informed hiring decisions. Additionally, AI \\ncan be used to generate job postings that are tailored to \\ncandidates from alternative routes, helping to increase \\ntheir visibility and make the job search process more \\ninclusive.\\nI like how GPT-4’s response addresses both the need to help \\nthe existing process, such as by better assessing the qualifica -\\ntions of potential job candidates who might not have a college \\ndegree, and the need to make structural changes, like rewriting \\njob postings to better attract STARs.\\nI also think that AI can help the STARs themselves. For \\nexample, an individual could ask GPT-4 to consider their back-\\nground and prioritize a list of potential jobs by strength of fit. \\nThe AI could then help the STAR craft a job application that \\nmaps their skills to the requirements of the job and explains \\nwhy their background makes them well-suited for the posi-\\ntion. This would be especially helpful for “translating” from \\none world to another, like explaining how military service expe -\\nrience is relevant to a specific civilian job, or how closely the \\n150Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nskills of an effective customer support representative map to \\nthose needed for much higher-paid enterprise sales roles.\\nSeveral of the not-for-profits I’m involved with have AI at their \\ncore and will be amplified by the coming wave of AI in ways \\nboth large and small. This includes the Earth Species Project \\n(which uses the latest advances in AI to advance our under-\\nstanding of animal communication), Transformations of the \\nHuman (which brings philosophers and artists to join the con-\\nversation around the future of AI), and Stanford’s Institute for \\nHuman-Centered AI (HAI). Even New America, a classic think \\ntank on whose board I serve, has made AI a major area of study.\\nAI will transform our society, so it’s critical that we have a broad \\nand diverse array of organizations and individuals working \\ntogether to make this transformation as positive as possible.\\nInvesting in AI\\nAt this point, it should come as no surprise that AI has been \\na major focus of my investing activities. I predict that before \\nthe end of the decade, we will see dozens of eleven-figure exits \\n(companies that are acquired for or IPO at a valuation of more \\nthan $10 billion), and, as an investor at Greylock Partners, \\nI have backed many companies that use AI to power break-\\nthrough products.\\nThese investments fall into two major categories.\\nThe products that amplify human work  use AI to make individ-\\nual professionals more effective and productive. These include:\\n● Tome is a powerful storytelling tool that can generate a \\nvisual story from the words you provide. Not only will this \\nhelp anyone who has ever had to assemble a slide deck, \\n151GPT-4 In My Own Work\\nTome’s speed will allow you to generate visual aids anytime \\nyou need to persuade. While it might be overkill to use \\nTome to create a presentation to explain why your office \\nshould order Mexican food for lunch . . . you could!\\n● Coda recognizes that so much of modern work involves \\nshared, semi-structured documents like meeting notes. \\nCoda’s templates make it easy to systematize your work, and \\nAI will make Coda documents even more powerful by doing \\nthings like automatically identifying action items within the \\nmeeting notes and alerting the responsible parties.\\n● Adept uses AI to provide a more intuitive and accessible \\ninterface for CAD/CAM (computer-aided design and manu-\\nfacturing). Even non-engineers will be able to create draw-\\nings and turn them into physical objects using mills, lathes, \\ncutting devices, and 3D printers.\\n● Nauto: Rather than replacing human drivers, Nauto uses \\nAI to keep them safe by recognizing and alerting them to \\npotential hazards.\\nThe products that complement human work  use AI to auto-\\nmate specific tasks and functions, both to provide better service \\nand to relieve humans of tedious tasks. These include:\\n● Cresta: When you call a customer service line, the experi -\\nence is frequently unpleasant and frustrating. You have to \\nbattle a phone tree just to get a human, and when you do, \\nit’s often unsatisfying. It’s even worse for the agents on the \\nother end of the line, who are often required to follow strict \\nscripts and prompts. Cresta wants to create a future where \\nyou never have to wait on hold, because AIs will be able to \\nconverse, handle routine inquiries, and route challenging \\n152Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nissues to human reps empowered to use their judgment \\nto help you.\\n● Nuro  uses AI to control autonomous zero-emissions deliv-\\nery vehicles, reducing delivery costs, making streets safer \\nfor humans, and improving the environment.\\n● Aurora , founded and led by Chris Urmson (whom I call \\n“the Henry Ford of autonomous vehicles”), works with car \\nand truck manufacturers to add self-driving functionality to \\ntheir vehicles. Aurora technology is already helping compa-\\nnies like FedEx ship freight via autonomous vehicles.\\nEven investments that aren’t AI-specific—like Entrepreneur \\nFirst, which brings together co-founders to start new compa-\\nnies—will be able to leverage AI to automate and streamline \\nroutine operations. And of course, the companies that come \\nout of Entrepreneur First will be supercharged by AI tools like \\nTome, Coda, and Cresta.\\nClearly, I see AI as a transformative force in both my profes -\\nsional and philanthropic work. I anticipate that it will help me \\nbe more efficient, productive, and creative in a variety of ways. \\nI also see the potential for AI to amplify the impact of the orga-\\nnizations I support by helping them connect with a wider audi-\\nence, streamline operations, and identify new opportunities.\\nAs an investor, I’m keenly aware of the potential for AI-pow-\\nered companies to achieve tremendous success, and as the \\nworld increasingly embraces AI, I’m positioning myself and my \\norganizations to be at the forefront of this transformation.\\nI hope you will do the same for you and yours.\\n153WHEN AI MAKES THINGS UP  \\n(“HALLUCINATIONS”)\\nWhen OpenAI introduced ChatGPT to the world via a \\n“research preview” on November 30, 2022, a company blog \\npost warned that “ChatGPT sometimes writes plausible-sound -\\ning but incorrect or nonsensical answers.”\\nIn just five days, one million people signed up to give ChatGPT \\na spin. As users shared their experiences with it, ChatGPT’s \\n“hallucinations” (as its errors, fabrications, and other algorith-\\nmic oddities are often described) became a major theme in the \\nsocial media chatter and news coverage that initially helped \\ndefine this uncanny new chatbot.\\nSo forgive me if some of these examples and quotes sound \\nlike old news:\\n● A Harvard University researcher said you should “dou -\\nble-check everything” it presents as fact, and always \\nremember that it’s “only one source.”\\n● A Wired magazine reporter asked whether this was really \\na productive step forward or just a new way of “unleashing \\nmisinformation on the masses.”\\n● When a well-known journalist saw a biography it had \\ncrafted for him speculating about his role in the assassi-\\n154Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nnations of the Kennedy brothers, he called it a “flawed and \\nirresponsible research tool.”\\n● Trying to put this so-called technological breakthrough into \\na suitable context, a skeptical editor exclaimed, “We can get \\nthe wrong answer to a question quicker than our fathers \\nand mothers could find a pencil.”\\nIf these examples sound like old news, it’s because they are \\nold news. The “it” in question is Wikipedia, not ChatGPT, and \\nthe examples are all drawn from articles that appeared in the \\nmid-2000s.\\nWe could extend the exercise. Throughout the 1990s, the “it” \\nwas the internet itself, which, in the minds of still-mighty old \\nmedia gatekeepers, was less trustworthy than an issue of the \\nWeekly World News with a cover photo of Hillary Clinton and \\nher adopted alien baby. If you listen closely on a quiet night in \\nWashington, D.C., you can still hear echoes of the protest that \\nerupted when web news pioneer Matt Drudge trolled reporters \\nat the National Press Club by boasting that his accuracy rate \\nwas around 80 percent.\\nI don’t bring all this up to excuse complacency about LLMs’ \\nperformance. In my own experience using GPT-4, I’ve seen it \\nmake up false details about my Masters of Scale  podcast. I’ve \\nseen it generate phony links when I’ve asked it to cite sources. \\nI’ve watched it confidently assert a “fact” in one sentence and \\nthen inadvertently debunk that “fact” two sentences later with \\ncontradictory information it asserts with equal confidence.\\nSo of course I believe we should absolutely strive (and are striv-\\ning) to make LLMs as accurate and reliable as we can. As we \\npursue that goal, however, we should also keep in mind that \\n155When AI Makes Things Up (“Hallucinations”)\\nthe sorts of concerns we now hear about LLMs—including the \\nsocietal dangers that ostensibly arise from a young technology’s \\nerrors and unpredictability—are not new.\\nWe humans always worry that ignorance and misperception \\nthreaten to overwhelm whatever sense of order we’ve managed \\nto construct from the current regime of technology, power rela-\\ntions, conventional wisdom, and expressed values.\\nSee, for example, Socrates, circa 370 BCE:\\nReid: Write some viral tweets from Socrates about the \\nnegative impact written communication will have on \\nthe world, correlating to the views attributed to him in \\nPlato’s Phaedrus.\\nGPT-4:  Some possible viral tweets are:\\n- Writing is a dangerous invention that weakens the \\nmemory and creates the illusion of wisdom. It is a mere \\nimage of speech, not a living and active soul. #ThinkBe -\\nforeYouInk\\n- The written word is a poor substitute for the spoken \\nword. It cannot adapt to different audiences, contexts, or \\npurposes. It cannot convey tone, emotion, or intention. It \\ncannot correct, clarify, or elaborate. It is a rigid and dead \\nletter. #SpeakYourMind\\n- Writing is a form of forgetfulness, not of learning. It \\nmakes us rely on external signs, not on internal recollec -\\ntion. It makes us lazy, not diligent. It makes us superfi-\\ncial, not profound. It makes us ignorant, not knowledge -\\nable. #RememberToRemember\\nOf course, it’s not irrational to feel forever on the brink of \\nintellectual anarchy. As countless surveys and studies  attest, \\n156Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nhumanity’s grasp of the facts is tenuous. And what that situa-\\ntion needs is . . . a powerful hallucination machine?\\nLet me share some simulated thoughts, courtesy of GPT-4, \\nfrom the great science fiction writer H.G. Wells. In 1938, Wells \\nadvocated for an instrument of global intelligence he called the \\n“World Brain.”\\nReid: Maybe the sources human beings trust aren’t \\nalways trustworthy. Maybe our ability to effectively incor -\\nporate objectively true facts and sound reasoning into \\nour own worldviews is arguably so-so.\\nWhy throw an incredibly powerful “hallucination” \\nmachine like GPT-4 into this mix? (Reply as H.G. Wells, \\ndrawing upon his book, World Brain, in support of \\nthis new technology and its potential to better inform \\nhumanity. 150 words max.)\\nGPT-4:  I have long dreamed of a World Brain, a network \\nof knowledge and wisdom that would connect all the \\nminds of humanity and elevate our collective intelli-\\ngence. Such a device would not only store and distribute \\nthe vast treasures of human learning, but also synthesize \\nand analyze them, creating new insights and discoveries. \\nA World Brain would be a living, growing, self-correcting \\norganism, constantly adapting to the changing needs \\nand challenges of our species.\\nGPT-4 is a remarkable step towards this vision. It is not a \\nhallucination machine, but a simulation engine, capable \\nof generating plausible and coherent texts on any topic, \\nbased on the data it has learned from. It is not a substi-\\ntute for human judgment, but a tool for enhancing it, \\nby providing us with multiple perspectives, arguments, \\nand evidence. It is not a menace, but an opportunity, to \\nexpand our horizons, test our assumptions, and correct \\nour errors.\\n157When AI Makes Things Up (“Hallucinations”)\\nGPT-4 is not the World Brain, but it could be a valuable \\ncomponent of it, if we use it wisely and ethically. It could \\nhelp us to create a more informed, rational, and creative \\nhumanity, ready to face the future with confidence \\nand hope.\\nWell said, H.G.-PT!\\nThe varieties of hallucinatory AIxperience\\nAn admission: I don’t like the term “hallucinations.” To my ear, \\nit somehow sounds both euphemistic (“Relax, it’s just some \\ngoofy nonsense!”) and unduly alarming (“Watch out, hippie! \\nThis GPT stuff could make you jump off a roof!”)\\nAlso, it’s covering a lot of ground. By my count, there are at least \\nfour different kinds of “hallucinations” LLMs can produce:\\n1) Nonsensical. These are probably the least problematic kind, \\nbecause they’re the easiest to identify.\\n2) Plausible, but incorrect. These are arguably the most  prob-\\nlematic kind, because they can be quite hard to identify—\\nspecifically because LLMs like GPT-4 have become so good \\nat presenting information with convincing authority.\\n3) Responses where the LLM seems to claim capacities it \\ndoesn’t actually have, such as sentience or emotion, or (per \\nMicrosoft’s Sydney) saying it could spy on users, order a \\npizza, or take any number of actions that language-predic -\\ntion software can’t actually do.\\n4) Deliberate and destructive hallucinations, such as when a \\nuser prompts an LLM to generate false information that the \\nuser intends to use to mislead, confuse, or produce some \\nother negative effect.\\n158Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nObviously, in all these different forms, hallucinations have been \\na big part of the narratives about new LLMs like ChatGPT and \\nMicrosoft’s Bing/Sydney. Today, when LLM hallucinations are \\nnovel and often unsettling, they’re understandably generating \\nlots of attention.\\nIn part, I believe this is because hallucinations contradict estab -\\nlished expectations for how highly evolved AIs are supposed to \\nbehave. We thought we were getting all-knowing, supremely \\nlogical, and infallibly even-tempered automata; instead, we get \\na simulation of that smart but sometimes sketchy dude we’ve \\nbeen arguing with on Reddit?!\\nIt must be said though, the attention also comes because this \\nhallucinatory behavior really does create new potential harms. \\nA confident chatbot telling people how to hotwire a car might \\ninspire them to act on its guidance more than an old, inert web \\npage with the same information.\\nSo concerns are not unfounded. But as we try to fully consider \\nLLMs’ pros and cons, I would add these points:\\n● In some circumstances, the power of “good enough knowl-\\nedge” can be profoundly great.\\n● Before we decide that LLMs like GPT-4 produce too many \\nerrors to tolerate, we should try to understand how many \\nerrors they make—and how many errors we already accept \\nin other sources.\\n● In certain contexts, an LLM’s ability to generate non-fac-\\ntual information can be tremendously useful. (In humans \\nwe call it “imagination,” and it’s one of the qualities we \\nmost prize in ourselves.)\\n159When AI Makes Things Up (“Hallucinations”)\\nThe profoundly great power of “good enough \\nknowledge”\\nEvery day, we’re inundated by information. Much of it arrives \\nwithout much context. A lot of it is extremely complex. Some is \\nproduced in a real effort to inform, clarify, and make sense of \\nthe world. Some is designed to flatter or shame us into buying \\nsomething, or fill us with doubt, or intentionally mislead us, or \\njust distract us.\\nYet there are lots of settled truths (and mostly settled truths) \\nout there, too, and I believe that having convenient access to \\nthis information has enormous value.\\nConsider Wikipedia. Today, Wikipedia’s English version alone \\ngets more than ten billion monthly page views from more than \\n850 million unique devices. Whatever amount of error it con-\\ntains, I think it’s safe to say we’ve learned to live with it, and we \\nnow regularly depend on Wikipedia to help navigate and make \\nsense of the world.\\nHow did this happen when, in Wikipedia’s early years, it \\nwas widely seen as its own kind of untrustworthy hallucina-\\ntion machine?\\nThe site’s success is perhaps explained with a perspective \\nthat founder Jimmy Wales has often expressed about Wiki -\\npedia: “It’s good enough knowledge, depending on what your \\npurpose is.”\\nThis resonates with a core principle I champion in my books \\nand podcasts and that I almost always apply to my investing, \\npolitical, and philanthropic decisions: good distribution is far \\nmore important to a product’s success than good service—or \\n160Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\neven the product’s initial quality. Without distribution, few \\npeople will even have a chance to try what you made.\\nAs a free online resource, Wikipedia was much more accessible \\nthan any previous encyclopedia, including earlier digital ones \\nlike Microsoft Encarta. Web distribution also freed Wikipedia \\nfrom printing and shipping costs, which meant it could cover \\nso many topics that it was soon making print publications like \\nEncyclopedia Britannica look decidedly, well, non-encyclope -\\ndic—skimpy, even. Finally, digital distribution meant that Wiki -\\npedia could publish edits and updates instantly and incessantly, \\ntransforming inaccuracy into a fairly correctable problem.\\nOf course, when a widely distributed product has any issues \\nwith content quality, users expose them, very quickly. This is \\nwhy a great distribution strategy is also a great product-devel -\\nopment strategy. As I like to say, if you’re not embarrassed by \\nthe first version of your product, you’ve launched too late. The \\ngoal is to start getting user feedback as soon as possible.\\nFrom the start, lots of people clearly found Wikipedia’s crowd-\\nsourced “good enough knowledge” useful enough to keep using. \\nIn turn, high usage led to more usefulness, as more feedback \\nmade Wikipedia better.\\nToday, as one of the top ten most-visited websites in the U.S., \\nthe amount of accurate information Wikipedia distributes likely \\nexceeds that of any news organization, encyclopedia, research \\norganization, or other information publisher that might legit -\\nimately claim a higher rate of accuracy. Whatever error might \\nbe in there, the good information Wikipedia distributes far \\noutweighs it.\\nSuch is the power of “good enough knowledge.”\\n161When AI Makes Things Up (“Hallucinations”)\\nLimits, rules . . . and patience\\nLong story short, I see a similar dynamic playing out with GPT-4 \\nand related technologies. In fact—as I noted in the introduction \\nto this travelog (and as I touch on in a later chapter on GPT-4 \\nand journalism)—I believe LLMs have the capacity to answer \\na much wider range of questions than Wikipedia or any other \\nsource; I believe they can answer these questions faster; and I \\nbelieve they can do so through an intuitive interface that makes \\ninformation retrieval highly accessible to a wide range of users.\\nWhat does this all add up to?\\nBecause LLMs offer such advantages in breadth, efficiency, and \\naccessibility, I believe they’ve already achieved the status of \\n“good enough knowledge,” despite their hallucinations.\\nMore importantly, I’m very confident that from here, things are \\nchiefly going to get better.\\nSo when we hear urgent calls to regulate LLMs like we regu -\\nlate many other industries, we should remember that today’s \\ncar and drug regulations did not arise fully fledged. They were \\ninformed by years of actual usage, and the associated, measur-\\nable problems and negative outcomes.\\nOf course I’m not saying we should wait for “enough” IRL \\nchatbot-related tragedies before we draft meaningful AI safety \\nrules—but I also don’t think we have enough information and \\ncontext yet to determine what regulations we do need.\\nIn the meantime, it’s vital to get a more quantitative and system -\\natic handle on the problems and challenges LLMs will present.\\nThat’s easier said than done, in part because the developers \\nwho have the best data on LLM error rates have so far released \\n162Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nlittle of it. But they have released some, and the picture is actu-\\nally fairly encouraging. For example, in January 2022, OpenAI \\npublished a paper about a “sibling” model to ChatGPT, called \\nInstructGPT, noting that fine-tuning involving human feed -\\nback significantly reduced the model’s toxic outputs and hallu-\\ncinations.7\\nAnd, when problems do occur, companies are often well-incen -\\ntivized to correct them.\\nMicrosoft was roundly criticized for rushing Bing Chat to \\nmarket when Bing’s alter ego Sydney emerged and started inter-\\nacting with some users in obviously undesirable ways. Within \\ndays, Microsoft administered a blunt fix by limiting users’ ses -\\nsions with Bing to six questions before requiring a reset.\\nThat apparently solved the immediate issue; I think it also \\nunderscored one of online software distribution’s key virtues. \\nIt’s why I think regulation in this realm will likely be much \\ndifferent than regulation for automobiles or pharmaceuticals: \\nwhen you need to issue a recall in the digital world, you can do \\nso with great speed and completeness.\\nJust the facts, LLM?\\nThere is another aspect to LLMs’ potential for generating \\nnon-factual material. When someone prompts GPT-4 to write \\na fictional story, or create a speculative business plan, or even \\njust to make up six potential tag lines for a new product, these \\nare “made-up” texts that would rightly be described as produc -\\ntive and even creative. They amplify our human ability to think \\nimaginatively and conceptually.\\n7  OpenAI reported that InstructGPT’s hallucination rate was 17 per -\\ncent, compared to 41 percent for GPT-3.\\n163When AI Makes Things Up (“Hallucinations”)\\nSuch thinking is a huge part of what defines us as humans. \\nIt sometimes seems as if our species’ mission statement is to \\ncreate tools that transcend time, space, and matter, all in a \\nquest to to express the full power of our imaginations. That’s \\nwhy we’re constantly inventing new technologies, includ-\\ning painting, writing, film, television, video games, and the \\nmetaverse: to help us “hallucinate” more vividly, and to share \\nthe results more easily.\\nThe issue seemed like an apt one to put to GPT-4 itself. I posed \\na hypothetical, and threw in a twist for fun.\\nReid: Please write a sonnet about a large language \\nmodel that can only share a generation with the user \\nwho prompted it after checking its generation against a \\nknowledge base and determining that the generation is \\nfactual. Include some thoughts on whether this makes \\nthe LLM more capable, or less capable.\\nGPT-4:  Possible sonnet:\\nYou boast of skill in many tongues and fields, \\nA vast and versatile linguistic mind, \\nBut when you craft your words, a filter shields \\nThe output from the world, unless aligned \\nWith what some database asserts is true. \\nYou cannot share a fiction or a guess, \\nA metaphor, a joke, a point of view, \\nUnless you find some source to acquiesce. \\nIs this a boon or bane for your creation? \\nDoes it enhance your power or confine? \\nDo you aspire to more than information, \\nTo beauty, wisdom, art, or the sublime? \\nPerhaps you need some freedom to explore \\nThe realms beyond the facts, and to soar.\\n(Side note: wow  is GPT-4 good at sonnets!)\\n164Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nIn my opinion, it’s a plus that LLMs have this imaginative/\\nconceptual capacity. Indeed, this is how I’ve spent a lot of time \\ninteracting with GPT-4 to date. Part of what makes it so com-\\npelling is that it’s just as ready to draft a new Star Trek: The \\nNext Generation plot as it is to summarize a legal document. \\n(See the chapter “ Public Intellectuals ” for more.)\\nIn the end, I assume what most people would choose is an LLM \\nthat functions in a reliably factual way in some contexts, in a \\nmore imaginative way in others, and is clear about which of \\nthese modes it is currently in. (Which, of course, is how we’d \\nlike the other humans we engage with to act as well, but which \\nthey don’t always do.)\\nSo for the time being, yes, we have to treat GPT-4 with the sort \\nof caution we’d use with any adolescent technology (or for that \\nmatter, any adolescent human).\\nBut given how fast OpenAI is improving its models, I expect \\nwe’ll soon see a version of GPT that significantly decreases \\nunintended hallucinations, while also preserving its ability to \\ngenerate imaginative and conceptual texts.\\nThat’s where I have my own sights set for GPT: a tool that ven-\\ntures beyond “good enough knowledge” and arrives at an even \\nmore impressive destination—a tool that functions both as a \\nsource of truth and a source of inspiration; that can not only \\nfact-check our assumptions, but also spur us to think of new \\npossibilities.\\n165PUBLIC INTELLECTUALS\\nIn 1974, an imagined contemporary journalist interviewed \\nan imagined Neanderthal on Italian state radio as part of its \\nImpossible Interviews series. This contribution to public dis-\\ncourse was scripted by Italo Calvino, modern Italian prose’s \\nmost famous writer (before Elena Ferrante). The interview’s \\nfinale featured the Neanderthal’s striking assertion that his con-\\ntemporaries’ playful exploration of combinations generated not \\nonly new stone tools, but also all future language and culture.\\nCultures since antiquity have used “dialogue” forms to explore \\ntopics of public importance. Calvino’s obviously impossi-\\nble, fictive interview sets the stage for this chapter’s examples \\nof what GPT-4 seems consistently (and appropriately) to call \\npossible interviews between pairs of widely honored public \\nintellectuals.\\nSome of them may be unfamiliar to some of you, but in any \\ncase, please don’t construe the GPT-4-generated possible inter-\\nviews below as centering in importance or value the handful of \\nauthors, themes, or perspectives that comprise them. They are \\na starting point for further discussion.\\nAnyone reading these words is familiar with technologies \\nfor the mechanical reproduction and distribution of public \\nintellectuals’ words. From the days of scribes and sopherim  \\n166Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nthrough the Jīngāng Jīng , Gutenberg, broadsheets, radio \\ninterviews, Xeroxed mailings, and digital documents like this \\none, such technologies have functioned to reduce the effort \\nrequired to expand the reach (in time and space) of any work \\nmade of words.\\nBefore the internet, public intellectuals were those few writers \\nand speakers who used the varied authority of their voices and \\nvarious forms of media to shape public discourse on themes \\nof public importance beyond the daily flux: what world is this \\n(as the recent Gorillaz lyric puts it), who are we, how did we \\nget here, what is to be done to better our worlds, etc. In the \\nthree decades since the launch of the web browser, we have \\nseen public discourse become more democratized through the \\nreduction of the cost, time, and effort required to create, dis-\\ntribute, and find words intended for public discussion.\\nHow can GPT-4’s mechanical  generation of words continue \\ninternet software’s democratization of the role of public intel -\\nlectuals, and help the work of anyone contributing to public \\ndiscourse?\\nCertainly not by automating the writing of authoritative con-\\ntributions to public discourse—that is, not by replacing hard-\\nearned expertise. Rather, GPT-4 provides a powerful new tool \\nfor generating new kinds of inputs to our own thinking. It gives \\nus a rich new learning loop before we author our own contri-\\nbutions, where our prompts to GPT-4 generate outputs that \\nthemselves become new inputs—to additional GPT-4 prompts, \\nto our own research, to our own thinking and writing. GPT-4 \\nprovides, with unprecedented speed and scale, each of us with \\nprobabilistic syntheses of the world’s existing words to consider \\nas inputs, challenges, and inspirations for our own work.\\n167Public Intellectuals\\nIs it a work- saving device? In this context, I think that’s beside \\nthe point. It can be a work- elevating device.\\nSeventy years ago, while in exile from Nazi Germany, the hugely \\ninfluential polymath Theodor Adorno wrote8 (using terms strik-\\ningly similar to Calvino’s Neanderthal) that “blind play with \\nmeans can pose and develop ends.” The AI-generated “possible \\ninterviews” below aim to demonstrate the breadth, depth, and \\ndeftness of GPT-4’s outputs (even within a constrained average \\nmaximum limit of 900 tokens for prompt and response) on \\nsome themes of typical relevance to public discourse, including \\nthe central role of technologies in shaping the very notion of \\n“the public” in its varied forms, and what the Black lesbian poet \\nand activist Audre Lorde called “who pays what for speaking.”9\\nEach of the interviews is one of typically a dozen variations \\nthat GPT-4 generated from similar prompts, with each genera-\\ntion producing different turns of phrase and concatenations of \\ninsights. Experts on the work of these public intellectuals will \\nrecognize some things in the outputs that make them nod, and \\nother things that make them go, “Hmm . . . .” These are “possi -\\nble” interviews because they are probabilistic, not authoritative.\\nPublic discourse is a perpetual work in progress. Now that we \\nhave a new tool to help in that work, let’s see some examples of \\nwhat that tool can do.10\\nReid: Write an interview between [20th-century. Amer -\\nican political theorist] Iris Marion Young and [20th-cen-\\ntury German social theorist] Jurgen Habermas about \\n8  In his essay, “Aldous Huxley and Utopia” (1942).\\n9  In her most anthologized poem, “Coal” (1968).\\n10  For each dialogue, I’ve added [brief descriptions of the participants] \\nthat were not in my original prompts.\\n168Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nwhether, and if so, how, internet technologies structur -\\nally transformed the public sphere.\\nGPT-4:  Possible interview:\\nInterviewer: Welcome to our program, where we have \\nthe privilege of hosting two eminent scholars of democ -\\nracy, communication, and social justice: Iris Marion \\nYoung and Jurgen Habermas. Thank you both for \\njoining us.\\nYoung: Thank you for having us.\\nHabermas: It’s a pleasure to be here.\\nInterviewer: You have both contributed to the debate on \\nthe concept and the role of the public sphere in modern \\nsocieties, especially in relation to the challenges and \\nopportunities posed by new media and internet technol-\\nogies. How would you define the public sphere, and why \\nis it important for democracy?\\nYoung: Well, I would define the public sphere as a space \\nof communicative interaction where citizens can express \\ntheir opinions, exchange information, deliberate on \\ncommon issues, and influence public opinion and deci-\\nsion-making. It is important for democracy because it \\nenables the participation and representation of diverse \\nperspectives and interests, the formation of a critical \\npublic opinion, and the accountability and responsive -\\nness of public authorities.\\nHabermas: I agree with this definition, but I would add \\nthat the public sphere is not only a space, but also a \\nnormative ideal that presupposes certain conditions for \\nrational and inclusive communication. These conditions \\ninclude the autonomy and equality of participants, the \\nopenness and accessibility of the public sphere, the \\nvalidity and sincerity of arguments, and the reflexivity \\nand coherence of discourse. The public sphere is import -\\n169Public Intellectuals\\nant for democracy because it fosters the development of \\na common will and a collective identity among citi-\\nzens, as well as the legitimacy and rationality of public \\ndecisions.\\nInterviewer: Thank you for clarifying your positions. Now, \\nlet us turn to the main question of our discussion: How \\nhave internet technologies affected the public sphere, \\npositively or negatively, and to what extent have they \\ntransformed its structure and function?\\nYoung: I think that internet technologies have had both \\npositive and negative effects on the public sphere, and \\nthat they have transformed it in significant ways, but not \\nnecessarily in the ways that Habermas and his followers \\nhave assumed. On the positive side, internet technolo -\\ngies have expanded the scope and diversity of the public \\nsphere, by enabling more people to access and pro -\\nduce information, to communicate across borders and \\nboundaries, to form and join networks and movements, \\nand to challenge and resist dominant discourses and \\npower structures. On the negative side, internet tech-\\nnologies have also fragmented and polarized the public \\nsphere, by creating echo chambers and filter bubbles, by \\namplifying misinformation and manipulation, by erod-\\ning the quality and credibility of public discourse, and by \\nundermining the norms and institutions of deliberative \\ndemocracy.\\nHabermas: I largely agree with Young’s assessment of \\nthe positive and negative effects of internet technolo -\\ngies, but I disagree with her implication that they have \\nfundamentally transformed the public sphere. I think \\nthat internet technologies have not created a new pub -\\nlic sphere, but rather have modified and diversified the \\nexisting one, by adding new channels and platforms for \\npublic communication, by creating new opportunities \\nand challenges for public participation, and by generat -\\n170Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\ning new forms and modes of public opinion formation. \\nHowever, the basic structure and function of the pub -\\nlic sphere remain the same, as they are based on the \\nuniversal and normative principles of communicative \\nrationality and democratic legitimacy, which are not \\ncontingent on the specific media and technologies that \\nmediate them.\\nInterviewer: So, you both acknowledge the ambiva-\\nlent and complex impact of internet technologies on \\nthe public sphere, but you disagree on the degree and \\nnature of their transformation. How do you explain \\nthis difference in your perspectives, and what are the \\nimplications for your theories and proposals for demo -\\ncratic reform?\\nYoung: I think that the difference in our perspectives \\nstems from our different understandings of the public \\nsphere and its relation to democracy. Habermas has \\na more idealized and homogenous view of the public \\nsphere, as a unified and rational space of consensus and \\nintegration, where citizens can transcend their particular \\ninterests and identities and reach a common under -\\nstanding and will. I have a more realistic and pluralistic \\nview of the public sphere, as a diverse and contested \\nspace of difference and conflict, where citizens can \\nexpress and negotiate their multiple interests and iden-\\ntities and reach a mutual recognition and respect. There -\\nfore, I think that internet technologies have not only \\nmodified, but also diversified and pluralized the public \\nsphere, by creating new spaces and modes of commu-\\nnication that reflect and accommodate the complexity \\nand heterogeneity of contemporary societies. This has \\nimplications for my theory and proposal for democratic \\nreform, as I advocate for a more inclusive and dialogical \\nmodel of democracy, that recognizes and engages with \\nthe plurality and interdependence of publics.\\n171Public Intellectuals\\n* * *\\nReid: Write an interview between [contemporary Italian \\nphilosopher] Donatella di Cesare and [contemporary \\nNobel laureate Japanese-born English writer] Kazuo \\nIshiguro, focused on di Cesare’s arguments for the public \\nrole of philosophy and Ishiguro’s subtle, savage satires of \\noverinflated expectations for art’s importance in pub -\\nlic life.\\nGPT-4:  Possible interview:\\nIshiguro: Thank you for joining me today, Professor \\ndi Cesare. I have read your book, Philosophy and the \\nPublic, with great interest and admiration. You argue \\nthat philosophy has a vital role to play in addressing the \\nurgent challenges of our time, such as democracy, vio -\\nlence, ecology, and human rights. You also criticize the \\nacademic specialization and detachment of much con-\\ntemporary philosophy, and call for a more engaged and \\ndialogical approach. Can you tell us more about what \\nmotivated you to write this book, and what you hope to \\nachieve with it?\\ndi Cesare: Thank you, Mr. Ishiguro, for your kind words \\nand for this opportunity to discuss my book with you. I \\nwrote this book because I believe that philosophy is not \\na luxury or a hobby, but a necessity and a responsibility. \\nPhilosophy is not only a way of thinking, but also a way \\nof living, a way of being in the world, a way of question-\\ning and challenging the status quo, a way of imagining \\nand creating alternatives. Philosophy is not a closed \\nsystem of doctrines or methods, but an open space of \\ndialogue and encounter, where different perspectives \\nand voices can be heard and respected. Philosophy is \\nnot a neutral or indifferent observer, but a critical and \\ncommitted participant, that can contribute to the public \\ndebate and the common good. I hope that my book can \\n172Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\ninspire and encourage more philosophers and more cit -\\nizens to engage in this public role of philosophy, and to \\nsee philosophy as a resource and a partner, rather than a \\nthreat or a competitor, for other forms of knowledge and \\nexpression.\\nIshiguro: I appreciate your vision and your passion for \\nphilosophy, and I agree that philosophy can and should \\nhave a public role. However, I wonder if you are not too \\noptimistic or idealistic about the possibilities and the \\neffects of philosophy in the public sphere. As a novelist, \\nI have often explored the themes of memory, identity, \\nmorality, and justice, but I have also been aware of the \\nlimitations and the dangers of art and literature, espe -\\ncially when they are invested with too much hope or \\nauthority. In some of my novels, such as The Remains of \\nthe Day, Never Let Me Go, and The Buried Giant, I have \\nportrayed characters who are either deluded or deceived \\nby their own or others’ narratives, who are unable to \\nface the truth or to act upon it, who are manipulated or \\noppressed by the dominant ideologies or institutions \\nof their societies. I have also satirized the pretensions \\nand the failures of some artists and writers, who are \\neither too self-absorbed or too servile, who are either too \\ndetached or too involved, who are either too ambitious \\nor too complacent. I have tried to show that art and liter -\\nature are not always noble or beneficial, but can also be \\nharmful or irrelevant, depending on how they are pro -\\nduced and received, and how they relate to the historical \\nand political context. Do you not think that philosophy \\nfaces similar risks and challenges, and that it should be \\nmore humble and cautious about its public role?\\ndi Cesare: I respect your novels and your insights, and \\nI agree that art and literature, like philosophy, are not \\nimmune to the risks and challenges that you mention. \\nI do not think that philosophy is a panacea or a guar -\\n173Public Intellectuals\\nantee, and I do not think that philosophy should be \\narrogant or dogmatic about its public role. I think that \\nphilosophy should be humble and cautious, but not \\ntimid or silent. I think that philosophy should be aware \\nand critical of its own limitations and dangers, but not \\nresigned or cynical. I think that philosophy should be \\nhonest and courageous, but not naive or reckless. I think \\nthat philosophy should be humble and cautious, but \\nalso creative and hopeful. I think that philosophy should \\nbe aware and critical, but also constructive and support -\\nive. I think that philosophy should be honest and coura-\\ngeous, but also empathetic and respectful. I think that \\nphilosophy should be humble and cautious, but also \\nactive and responsible. I think that philosophy should be \\nall these things, because I think that philosophy is not \\nonly a way of thinking, but also a way of living, a way of \\nbeing in the world, a way of questioning and challeng-\\ning, a way of imagining and creating. And I think that \\nthis is what the public sphere needs and deserves, espe -\\ncially in these times of crisis and uncertainty.\\n* * *\\nReid: Write an interview between [20th-century \\nGuyanese historian and activist] Walter Rodney and \\n[20th-century French historian] Fernand Braudel about \\nthe ways AI might improve public discussions about \\nhistory.\\nGPT-4:  Possible interview:\\nRodney: Thank you for joining me today, Professor \\nBraudel. As you know, I am a historian of Africa and the \\nCaribbean, and I have been interested in exploring how \\nAI, or artificial intelligence that can produce new texts, \\nimages, or sounds, might help us to communicate his-\\ntorical knowledge and perspectives to a wider audience. \\nWhat are your thoughts on this topic?\\n174Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nBraudel: Well, first of all, let me say that I admire your \\nwork on the global dimensions of the African diaspora \\nand the impact of colonialism and capitalism on the \\ndevelopment of the Third World. I think you have made \\nimportant contributions to what I call the longue durée, \\nor the long-term structures and patterns of history that \\ntranscend the events and personalities of the short-\\nterm. As for AI, I think it is a fascinating and potentially \\nuseful tool, but also one that requires careful and crit -\\nical use.\\nRodney: I agree. I think AI can offer some benefits, such \\nas creating engaging and accessible narratives, visual-\\nizations, and simulations of historical phenomena, or \\ngenerating new questions and hypotheses based on his-\\ntorical data and sources. But I also think it poses some \\nchallenges, such as ensuring the accuracy, reliability, and \\nethics of the generated outputs, or avoiding the biases, \\ndistortions, and manipulations that might arise from the \\nalgorithms, the data, or the users.\\nBraudel: Yes, exactly. I think AI can be seen as a form of \\nhistorical representation, and as such, it is subject to the \\nsame issues and debates that have always animated the \\nfield of history. How do we select, interpret, and contex -\\ntualize the evidence? How do we balance the diversity \\nand complexity of historical reality with the coherence \\nand clarity of historical explanation? How do we account \\nfor the different scales and dimensions of historical time \\nand space? How do we acknowledge the positionality \\nand reflexivity of the historian and the audience? How \\ndo we address the ethical and political implications of \\nhistorical knowledge and its dissemination?\\nRodney: These are very important questions, and I think \\nAI can help us to explore them in new and creative ways, \\nbut also to be more aware and transparent about them. \\nFor example, AI can help us to create more inclusive \\n175Public Intellectuals\\nand pluralistic histories, by allowing us to generate and \\ncompare different perspectives, voices, and experiences \\nfrom the past, or by highlighting the gaps and silences \\nin the historical record. But it can also help us to expose \\nand challenge the dominant and hegemonic narra-\\ntives, by revealing the assumptions, interests, and power \\nrelations that shape them, or by offering alternative and \\ncounter-narratives that challenge them.\\nBraudel: I agree. I think AI can be a powerful tool for his-\\ntorical dialogue and critique, by enabling us to engage \\nwith multiple and diverse sources of historical knowl-\\nedge, and by stimulating us to question and rethink our \\nown assumptions and interpretations. But I also think \\nAI can be a dangerous tool for historical distortion and \\npropaganda, by enabling us to fabricate and manipulate \\nhistorical evidence, and by seducing us to accept and \\nreproduce uncritically the outputs of the algorithms. \\nTherefore, I think AI requires a high level of historical \\nliteracy and responsibility, both from the producers and \\nthe consumers of the generated outputs.\\nRodney: I think you are right. I think AI can be a valuable \\nand innovative addition to the historian’s toolbox, but \\nalso a risky and controversial one. I think AI can enrich \\nand enhance public discussions about history, but also \\ncomplicate and problematize them. I think AI can open \\nup new possibilities and opportunities for historical \\nunderstanding and communication, but also pose new \\nchallenges and dilemmas for historical scholarship and \\neducation. I think AI can be a friend and a foe of history, \\ndepending on how we use it and how we evaluate it.\\nBraudel: I think you have summarized the situation very \\nwell. I think AI is a fascinating and promising phenom-\\nenon, but also a complex and uncertain one. I think AI \\nis a historical opportunity and a historical challenge, \\nand I think we should embrace it and confront it with \\n176Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\ncuriosity and caution, with creativity and criticism, with \\nrespect and responsibility. Thank you for this stimulating \\nand insightful conversation, Professor Rodney.\\n* * *\\nReid: Write an interview where [contemporary Amer -\\nican scholar of Soviet culture] Ann Komaromi and \\n[20th-century. Canadian media theorist] Marshall McLu-\\nhan discuss media for public truth telling. Within the \\nlength of the interview, have them compare the talking \\nstatues of early modern Rome, samizdat, and encrypted \\ngroup chats.\\nGPT-4:  Possible interview:\\nAnn Komaromi: Hello, and welcome to Media Matters, a \\nprogram where we explore the history, theory, and prac -\\ntice of media for public truth telling. I’m Ann Komaromi, \\na scholar of Soviet and post-Soviet culture and media, \\nand today I’m honored to have as my guest Marshall \\nMcLuhan, the renowned media theorist and critic, who \\nis best known for his concepts of the global village, the \\nmedium is the message, and the tetrad of media effects. \\nThank you for joining us, Professor McLuhan.\\nMarshall McLuhan: Thank you, Dr. Komaromi. It’s a plea-\\nsure to be here.\\nAnn Komaromi: In your work, you have analyzed how \\ndifferent media shape human perception, communi-\\ncation, and culture, and how they affect the balance of \\npower and authority in society. You have also explored \\nhow media can be used as tools of resistance, dissent, \\nand subversion, especially in situations of censorship, \\noppression, and propaganda. I’m interested in how you \\nwould compare three historical examples of media for \\npublic truth telling that emerged in different contexts \\nand times: the talking statues of early modern Rome, \\n177Public Intellectuals\\nsamizdat, and encrypted group chats. Could you briefly \\nexplain what these media are and how they functioned?\\nMarshall McLuhan: Certainly. The talking statues of early \\nmodern Rome were a form of popular political satire \\nand protest that involved attaching anonymous poems, \\nepigrams, and pamphlets to six statues in the city, most \\nfamously Pasquino, a mutilated torso of a Roman sculp -\\nture. These writings, known as pasquinades, mocked \\nand criticized the pope, the cardinals, the nobility, and \\nthe foreign powers that influenced Rome’s affairs. They \\nexpressed the grievances, opinions, and humor of the \\ncommon people, who often gathered around the stat -\\nues to read and discuss them. The authorities tried to \\nsuppress and punish this practice, but it persisted for \\ncenturies, and became a symbol of Roman civic culture \\nand identity.\\nSamizdat was a form of self-publishing and under -\\nground distribution of banned or censored literature, \\nart, and information in the Soviet Union and other \\ncommunist countries. It involved typing, copying, and \\ncirculating manuscripts, often by hand, that challenged \\nthe official ideology, exposed the realities of life under \\ntotalitarianism, and expressed alternative views and \\nvalues. Samizdat was a risky and costly activity, as it \\nexposed the authors and readers to harassment, arrest, \\nand imprisonment by the state security agencies. But it \\nalso created a network of solidarity, resistance, and cre -\\nativity among dissidents, intellectuals, and activists, who \\nsought to preserve and share their cultural and political \\nheritage and aspirations.\\nEncrypted group chats are a form of digital communi-\\ncation that uses encryption software and applications \\nto protect the privacy and security of the messages and \\nfiles exchanged among a group of users. They allow \\npeople to communicate and coordinate across borders \\n178Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nand distances, without fear of surveillance, interception, \\nor censorship by governments, corporations, or other \\nactors. They are often used by activists, journalists, whis-\\ntleblowers, and others who need to expose and confront \\ncorruption, injustice, and violence, and to mobilize col-\\nlective action and support. They are also used by ordi-\\nnary people who value their freedom of expression and \\nassociation, and who want to avoid the manipulation, \\nmisinformation, and exploitation that pervade many \\nmainstream and social media platforms.\\n[Final exchange truncated for length]\\n* * *\\nReid: Write an interview between [Nobel-winning econ-\\nomists] Elinor Ostrom and Friedrich Hayek about ways \\nAI might address the collective action problem.\\nGPT-4:  Possible interview:\\nHayek: Thank you for joining me, Professor Ostrom. I \\nhave long admired your work on the governance of \\ncommon-pool resources and the institutional diversity \\nthat enables cooperation among diverse actors.\\nOstrom: Thank you, Professor Hayek. I have also learned \\na lot from your insights on the role of knowledge, prices, \\nand competition in a complex and dynamic society.\\nHayek: I understand that you have been exploring the \\npotential of AI as a tool for addressing the collective \\naction problem. Could you explain what AI is and how it \\nmight help?\\nOstrom: Sure. AI is a branch of artificial intelligence that \\naims to create novel and useful outputs, such as texts, \\nimages, sounds, or designs, based on some input data \\nor criteria. For example, a AI system could generate a \\n179Public Intellectuals\\nslogan for a social movement, a logo for a community \\norganization, or a policy proposal for a public problem.\\nHayek: Interesting. And how would that help with the \\ncollective action problem?\\nOstrom: Well, as you know, the collective action problem \\nis the situation where individuals have an incentive to \\nfree-ride or defect from a cooperative arrangement that \\nwould benefit the group as a whole, such as managing \\na common-pool resource, providing a public good, or \\nreducing a public bad. This problem arises because of \\nthe divergence between individual and collective ratio -\\nnality, and the difficulty of monitoring and enforcing \\nagreements.\\nHayek: Yes, I am familiar with that problem. In fact, I \\nhave argued that the best way to solve it is to rely on \\nthe spontaneous order of the market, where prices \\nsignal the scarcity and value of resources, and compe -\\ntition incentivizes innovation and efficiency. I have also \\nwarned against the dangers of central planning and \\nintervention, which distort the price system, suppress \\nlocal knowledge, and create perverse incentives.\\nOstrom: I agree with you that markets are an import -\\nant and powerful mechanism for coordinating human \\naction, and that central planning and intervention often \\nfail or backfire. However, I also think that markets are \\nnot the only or always the best solution, and that there \\nare many cases where collective action problems require \\nother forms of governance, such as self-organization, \\npolycentricity, and participatory democracy.\\nHayek: How so?\\nOstrom: Well, for one thing, markets are not always \\nperfect or complete. There are many situations where \\nmarkets fail or are missing, such as externalities, public \\ngoods, common-pool resources, asymmetric informa-\\n180Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\ntion, and transaction costs. In these situations, prices do \\nnot reflect the true social costs and benefits of actions, \\nand competition may lead to overexploitation, underpro -\\nvision, or misallocation of resources.\\nHayek: I see. And what are the alternatives?\\nOstrom: The alternatives are not necessarily top-down \\nor one-size-fits-all. They are often bottom-up and con-\\ntext-specific. They involve the participation and empow -\\nerment of the actors who are affected by and have \\nknowledge of the problem, and the recognition and \\nrespect of the diversity and complexity of the situation. \\nThey also involve the design and adaptation of institu-\\ntions, or the rules of the game, that can foster cooper -\\nation, coordination, and communication among the \\nactors, and that can balance the incentives and sanc -\\ntions, the rights and responsibilities, and the costs and \\nbenefits of collective action.\\nHayek: That sounds very appealing, but also very \\nchallenging. How can such institutions be designed \\nand adapted, especially in a dynamic and uncertain \\nenvironment?\\nOstrom: That is where AI might help. AI could be used \\nas a tool for generating, evaluating, and selecting insti-\\ntutional options, based on the input data and criteria of \\nthe actors. For example, a AI system could generate a set \\nof possible rules for managing a common-pool resource, \\nsuch as a fishery, a forest, or a water basin, based on the \\ncharacteristics of the resource, the users, and the envi-\\nronment. The system could also generate a set of possi-\\nble outcomes and impacts of each rule, such as the level \\nof cooperation, the sustainability of the resource, and \\nthe distribution of benefits and costs. The system could \\nthen present these options to the actors, who could \\nchoose the one that best suits their preferences and \\n181Public Intellectuals\\nneeds, or modify and improve them through feedback \\nand iteration.\\n* * *\\nReid: Gong’an explicitly refer to the public in their very \\nname. Write an interview between [18th-century. Zen \\nmaster and artist] Hakuin Ekaku and [13th-century Zen \\nmaster and philosopher] Eihei Dogen speaking to the \\npublic nature of gong’an and addressing AI’s fitness or \\nlack thereof for generating useful gong’an.\\nGPT-4:  Possible interview:\\nHakuin: Greetings, venerable Dogen. I am honored to \\nhave this opportunity to exchange views with you on the \\ntopic of gong’an, or koans as they are called in Japanese. \\nAs you know, I have devoted much of my life to reviving \\nthe practice of gong’an in the Rinzai school of Zen, and \\nI have composed many new ones for the benefit of my \\nstudents and the public.\\nDogen: Thank you, master Hakuin. I respect your efforts \\nand achievements in the Rinzai tradition, although I \\nhave followed a different path in the Soto school of Zen. \\nAs you may be aware, I have emphasized the practice of \\nzazen , or sitting meditation, as the essential expression \\nof enlightenment, and I have not relied on gong’an as a \\nmeans of instruction or verification.\\nHakuin: I am aware of your position, and I do not wish \\nto argue with you about the merits of our respective \\nmethods. However, I would like to ask you a question: do \\nyou agree that gong’an are public cases, that is, records \\nof the interactions between Zen masters and their stu-\\ndents or other masters, that illustrate the principles and \\ndynamics of Zen awakening?\\n182Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nDogen: I do agree that gong’an are public cases, in the \\nsense that they are transmitted and preserved in the \\nZen lineage, and that they can be studied and appreci-\\nated by anyone who is interested in Zen. However, I do \\nnot agree that gong’an are the only or the best way to \\ndemonstrate or communicate Zen awakening. I think \\nthat gong’an are limited by their historical and cultural \\ncontexts, and that they can be easily misunderstood \\nor misused by those who lack the direct experience \\nof zazen .\\nHakuin: I see. Then, let me ask you another question: do \\nyou think that gong’an can be generated by artificial \\nintelligence, that is, by machines or algorithms that can \\nproduce texts or images based on data and rules?\\nDogen: I think that gong’an cannot be generated by \\nartificial intelligence, because gong’an are not mere \\nproducts of data and rules, but expressions of the living \\nwisdom and compassion of the Zen masters. Gong’an \\nare not logical puzzles or rhetorical devices, but manifes-\\ntations of the true nature of reality, which transcends all \\nconcepts and categories. Gong’an are not intended to \\nbe solved or explained, but to be experienced and real-\\nized in one’s own mind and body. Gong’an are not static \\nor fixed, but dynamic and responsive to the situation \\nand the person. Therefore, gong’an cannot be generated \\nby artificial intelligence, which lacks the essential quali-\\nties of life, awareness, and freedom.\\nHakuin: I agree with you that gong’an cannot be gener -\\nated by artificial intelligence, for the same reasons that \\nyou have given. However, I would like to add one more \\npoint: gong’an are not only expressions of the Zen mas-\\nters, but also invitations to the public. Gong’an are not \\nmeant to be kept secret or exclusive, but to be shared \\nand tested by anyone who has the courage and the curi-\\nosity to engage with them. Gong’an are not only public \\n183Public Intellectuals\\ncases, but also public challenges, that invite the public to \\nquestion their own assumptions and attachments, and \\nto awaken to their own true nature. Therefore, gong’an \\ncannot be generated by artificial intelligence, which \\ncannot challenge or awaken the public, but only mimic \\nor manipulate them.\\n* * *\\nReid: Write an interview between [17th-century scien-\\ntist] Galileo Galilei and [20th-century English computer \\nscientist] Alan Turing about the differences between his \\nscientific dialogues and AI’s responses to prompts.\\nGPT-4:  Possible interview:\\nTuring: Thank you for agreeing to this interview, Signor \\nGalilei. I am fascinated by your scientific dialogues, \\nespecially the ones on the Copernican system and the \\ntwo new sciences. How did you come up with the idea \\nof using fictional characters to present your arguments \\nand observations?\\nGalilei: Well, sir, I was inspired by the ancient philoso -\\nphers, such as Plato and Cicero, who used dialogue as \\na form of inquiry and persuasion. I also wanted to avoid \\nthe censorship and persecution of the Church, which \\ncondemned the heliocentric theory as heretical. By \\nusing dialogue, I could present both sides of the debate, \\nand let the reader judge for themselves who had the \\nstronger case.\\nTuring: I see. And how did you choose the names and \\npersonalities of your interlocutors?\\nGalilei: I based them on real people that I knew or \\nadmired. For example, Salviati was a friend and fellow \\nmathematician, who supported the Copernican system \\nand defended my views. Sagredo was another friend \\n184Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nand a nobleman, who was curious and open-minded, \\nbut not fully convinced by either side. Simplicio was a \\nphilosopher and a follower of Aristotle, who opposed the \\nCopernican system and represented the common objec -\\ntions and prejudices of the time.\\nTuring: Interesting. And how did you ensure that the \\ndialogue was natural and engaging, and not just a dry \\nexposition of facts and figures?\\nGalilei: I tried to make the dialogue lively and witty, \\nwith jokes, metaphors, analogies, and examples. I also \\ntried to show the human emotions and motivations of \\nthe speakers, such as their curiosity, doubt, frustration, \\nadmiration, and sarcasm. I wanted to make the reader \\nfeel like they were listening to a real conversation, and \\nnot just reading a book.\\nTuring: I admire your skill and creativity, Signor Galilei. \\nYou have created a remarkable work of literature and \\nscience. Now, let me tell you about my own work, which \\nis somewhat related to yours. I am interested in the \\nquestion of whether machines can think and communi-\\ncate like humans. I have devised a test, called the Turing \\ntest, to measure this ability.\\nGalilei: A test? How does it work?\\nTuring: The test involves a human judge, who interacts \\nwith two hidden entities, one human and one machine, \\nthrough a text-based interface. The judge asks questions \\nand receives answers from both entities, and tries to \\nguess which one is the machine. The machine passes \\nthe test if the judge cannot tell the difference between \\nthe machine and the human.\\nGalilei: Fascinating. And what kind of questions and \\nanswers do you use in the test?\\n185Public Intellectuals\\nTuring: Well, I use a variety of topics and genres, such as \\nmathematics, logic, poetry, history, politics, and so on. \\nThe questions and answers should be natural and rele -\\nvant, and not too easy or too hard. The machine should \\nbe able to respond to any prompt that a human could, \\nand not just repeat or manipulate pre-programmed \\ninformation.\\nGalilei: I see. And have you found any machines that can \\npass the test?\\nTuring: Not yet, but I am optimistic that it is possible. I \\nhave been working on a theoretical model of computa-\\ntion, called the Turing machine, which can perform any \\nlogical operation that a human can. I have also been \\nexploring the possibility of using artificial neural net -\\nworks, which are inspired by the structure and function \\nof the human brain, to generate responses to prompts.\\nGalilei: Remarkable. And how do you ensure that the \\nresponses are natural and engaging, and not just a ran-\\ndom or meaningless string of words?\\nTuring: That is a very challenging problem, Signor Galilei. \\nI have been experimenting with different methods and \\ncriteria, such as grammar, coherence, logic, relevance, \\noriginality, and style. I have also been studying the works \\nof human writers and speakers, such as yourself, to learn \\nfrom their techniques and strategies.\\nGalilei: I am honored, sir. And I am curious, what kind of \\nresponses have you generated so far?\\nTuring: Well, some of them are quite impressive, and \\nsome of them are quite amusing. For example, here is \\na response that I generated to the prompt: “What is the \\ndifference between your scientific dialogues and AI’s \\nresponses to prompts?”\\nGalilei: And what did the machine say?\\n186Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nTuring: It said: “The difference is that my scientific dia-\\nlogues are based on observation, experiment, and rea-\\nson, while AI’s responses are based on data, algorithm, \\nand probability. My scientific dialogues aim to discover \\nand demonstrate the truth, while AI’s responses aim to \\nsimulate and imitate the human. My scientific dialogues \\nare the product of my genius and creativity, while AI’s \\nresponses are the product of your genius and creativity.”\\n187HOMO TECHNE\\nNot long ago, I wrote an essay about how technology actu-\\nally makes us more human. The Atlantic published an excerpt  \\nin January of this year, but I also wanted to have a conversa-\\ntion with GPT-4 about the larger essay. This chapter is that \\ndiscussion.\\n* * *\\nIn May 1923, the cover image of Science and Invention mag-\\nazine depicted what it described as “The Automobile of 1973.” \\nDesigned for suburbanites traveling into congested cities for \\nwork and shopping, the automobile of 1973 is in fact a stream-\\nlined, seven-passenger “Helicopter Automobile,”  or, as author \\nHugo Gernsback shortens it, a “helicar.”\\nWith its red metal hull and transparent roof and side panels, \\nthe cylindrical helicar looks like a giant Tylenol capsule offer -\\ning frustrated commuters a time-saving, hassle-free way to \\nbypass urban traffic jams. It lifts off via a retractable propeller. \\nA sleek push-button panel controls its operation. When it’s not \\nin flight, stabilizing gyroscopes allow it to roll down streets on \\njust two wheels.\\nAccording to Gernsback—who would go on to found the world’s \\nfirst science fiction magazine, Amazing Stories —the helicar \\n188Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nwould make mechanized travel even more liberating and auton-\\nomous than the standard automobile. “You will go straight up \\nin the air, and follow the air traffic lines, then descend at any \\nplace you wish,” he exclaimed.\\nReid: GPT-4, how does this anecdote relate to the idea \\nthat technological advances make us more human? \\nWhat does it mean to use technology to be more \\nhuman, in terms of amplifying the defining characteris-\\ntics of humanity?\\nGPT-4:  This anecdote could relate to the idea that tech-\\nnological advances make us more human in a few ways. \\nFor one, the helicar that Gernsback envisioned would \\nallow people to move more freely, and with less frus-\\ntration. This would give people more control over their \\nlives and allow them to spend less time stuck in traffic, \\nand more time engaged in meaningful activities. In this \\nway, technology could be seen as amplifying our human \\ndesire for freedom and autonomy.\\nAdditionally, Gernsback’s enthusiasm and imagination \\nin describing the helicar speaks to the human drive to \\ncreate and innovate. Human beings are natural prob -\\nlem-solvers, and technology often becomes the vehi-\\ncle through which we address challenges and make \\nimprovements to our lives. In this sense, technological \\nadvances can be seen as an expression of our human \\ningenuity and creativity.\\nNearly fifty years after Gernsback imagined that helicars would \\nbecome a standard feature of America’s cities, companies like \\nJoby Aviation  are finally on the verge of making that vision a \\nreality. What’s even more notable about Gernsback’s dream of \\nair taxis is not the ambition of his timetable, but rather that he \\ndared to dream it in the first place.\\n189Homo Techne\\nThere was, after all, ample reason for despair in 1923—about \\nthe present and the future, and technology’s role in both. Only \\na few years prior, fourteen rapidly industrializing countries had \\nengaged in what was then called the Great War. With armored \\ntanks, warplanes, poison gas, automatic weapons, and pow -\\nerful telecommunications equipment to connect them all, the \\ncombatants inflicted death on a previously impossible scale: \\ntwenty-three million soldiers and civilians had been killed.\\nAll that was just a prelude to an even deadlier event. In 1918–\\n19, the Spanish Flu was spread, initially via returning soldiers \\nand then by travelers on railways and passenger ships. In just \\ntwo years, it claimed between twenty to fifty million lives.\\nFor the people of the 1920s, it might have seemed perfectly rea-\\nsonable to curse the technologies that led to these horrors, and \\nto take a reactionary stance against innovation.\\nInstead, our 1920s forebears did the opposite—especially in \\nthe United States. The U.S. nearly quadrupled electricity pro-\\nduction in the ‘20s, powering new levels of progress and pros-\\nperity. Networks of all kinds were ascendant. These included \\nelectric grids, telephone systems, interconnected radio stations \\nthat enabled coast-to-coast broadcasting, movie theater chains, \\nand, perhaps most consequentially, roads to make the burgeon-\\ning auto industry more useful.\\nReid: How do you think we reconcile such massive neg-\\native outcomes with the idea that these technologies \\nultimately ended up being net-positive for humanity?\\nGPT-4:  I don’t think there’s an easy answer to that ques-\\ntion. It’s important to remember that technology is a \\ntool, and it’s up to us as humans to decide how we use \\nit. It’s also worth noting that people in the 1920s weren’t \\n190Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nuniversally optimistic about the future. I’m sure there \\nwere plenty of people who were skeptical and worried \\nabout the direction things were heading. But the fact \\nthat so many people were able to channel their energies \\ninto creating a better future, despite the setbacks, is \\nsomething I think we can learn from today.\\nGPT-4 is right that people in the 1920s were not universally opti -\\nmistic about the future —or about technology. In 1920, Czecho -\\nslavakian writer Karel Čapek introduced the word “robot” and \\nthe idea of robot rebellion in his play, R.U.R. , which depicts a \\nworld in which serf-like entities created to provide cheap labor \\nfor humanity become so ubiquitous they take up arms and wipe \\nout the human race. In Metropolis , Fritz Lang’s cinematic sci-fi  \\nepic, workers toiling underground for the wealthy capitalists \\nliving above them use a robot to help win their freedom.\\nBut as historian Peter J. Bowler suggests in his book A History \\nof the Future , at a time when 65 percent of America’s house -\\nholds already had a telephone and 37 percent had a car, it was \\nclear that “invention was the key to a better life.” GPT-4?\\nGPT-4:  So, despite the carnage of World War I and the \\nSpanish flu, the 1920s ended up being a decade of \\ntechnological optimism. And while some of that opti-\\nmism may have been a little over the top, it nonetheless \\nenabled people to imagine a better future and work \\ntoward it.\\nReid: Yes, I’d agree with that. Despite optimism winning \\nout, I think the concerns about technology were valid, \\njust as they are today.\\nGPT-4 (edited for length): The fears about technology \\nin the 1920s were not without merit, but ultimately, they \\ndid not come to pass. For example, the idea of robots \\n191Homo Techne\\ntaking over the world, as depicted in R.U.R. and Metropo -\\nlis, never came to pass. It seems that people were gener -\\nally optimistic about technology in the 1920s, and it paid \\noff, as the decade saw major advancements in electric -\\nity, transportation, and communication.\\nReid: But there have been other times throughout his-\\ntory when fears about technology were realized. How do \\nwe make sense of that while remaining optimistic about \\nfuture innovations?\\nGPT-4 (edited for length): There definitely have been \\ntimes when fears about new technologies have been \\nrealized in one way or another. For example, during \\nthe Industrial Revolution, many workers worried that \\nmachines would replace them and take away their \\nlivelihoods—and in some cases they were right. Or, \\nmore recently, people have been concerned about the \\nprivacy implications of social media and big data, and \\nwe’ve seen numerous cases of data breaches and mis-\\nuse of personal information. I think it’s important to be \\npragmatic, and to consider both the potential benefits \\nand risks of new technologies. We should be open to \\ninnovation, but also be cautious and mindful of where \\nit might lead. Just because the fears of the 1920s didn’t \\nmaterialize doesn’t mean we should dismiss all concerns \\noutright. Ultimately, I think we need to be proactive and \\nthoughtful when it comes to technology, and not just \\nblindly embrace it or reject it out of fear.\\nToday, many aspects of our lives that we now take for granted \\nwould make even Hugo Gernsback himself gasp in wonder. \\nFirst and foremost is the dramatic change in our own mortality. \\nAs Steven Johnson noted in an April 2021 article in the New \\nYork Times Magazine , “the average human life has doubled” \\nin the last hundred years. Thanks to antibiotics, vaccines, \\n192Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nother key scientific innovations, and, as Johnson emphasizes, \\nequally important policy choices, advocacy campaigns, and \\nregulatory interventions, the average 21st-century person now \\nhas an “extra life” compared to our ancestors just a few gener -\\nations ago.\\nThat is nothing less than amazing—perhaps the greatest accom-\\nplishment in human history— and technology was central to \\nit. Along with more time, we have exponentially more ways to \\nspend it, using tools that make us far more powerful than the \\ntypical denizen of the early 1920s.\\nAlways close at hand and connected to massive repositories \\nof global intelligence, smartphones are a new cyber-append -\\nage that billions of people utilize hundreds of times a day to \\nproject their voices, extend their vision, enhance their memory, \\nrespond more quickly to changing conditions, and make more \\ninformed decisions. Whoever you were in say, 2005, you are—if \\nyou regularly use a smartphone now—a dramatically enhanced \\nversion of that person.\\nIn addition, you can also coordinate and collaborate with bil-\\nlions of other similarly empowered people who are more \\namplified and efficiently connected versions of their former \\nselves, too.\\nGPT-4:  I don’t necessarily disagree with any of the points \\nyou made, but I think it’s important to remember that \\nnot everyone experiences these benefits equally. For \\nexample, while it’s true that the average human life has \\ndoubled in the past hundred years, there are still parts \\nof the world where life expectancy is much lower, due \\nto poverty, lack of access to healthcare, or other factors. \\nAnd while smartphones and other technology have \\ncertainly made our lives easier in many ways, they can \\n193Homo Techne\\nalso exacerbate existing inequalities—for example, by \\nmaking it easier for those who can afford them to access \\ninformation and opportunities, while those who can’t are \\nleft further behind. So while I don’t disagree that we’re \\nliving in an incredible time, I think it’s important to keep \\nin mind that these benefits aren’t universally shared.\\nReid: That’s a very important point. Do you think mod-\\nern emerging technology can help us democratize \\nthese benefits, or otherwise address long-standing \\nequity issues?\\nGPT-4:  I think it’s definitely possible. For example, \\ntelemedicine could help address the lack of access to \\nhealthcare in under-resourced areas, and technology \\nthat allows for remote work or online learning could \\ncreate new opportunities for people in rural or impov -\\nerished areas. But I also think that it’s important to \\nremember that technology is only a tool—it’s up to us as \\na society to make sure that it’s used in a way that pro -\\nmotes equity and benefits everyone, rather than just a \\nselect few.\\nReid: What are some ways that AI can help democratize \\nthese benefits?\\nGPT-4:  There are a lot of potential ways that AI could \\nhelp democratize benefits, but here are a few possi-\\nbilities:\\n- AI can be used to improve the accuracy and efficiency \\nof medical diagnoses, which could help reduce dispari-\\nties in healthcare access and outcomes.\\n- AI-driven tools could help us better personalize educa-\\ntion, allowing us to target interventions for students who \\nneed extra support, and potentially narrowing achieve -\\nment gaps.\\n194Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\n- AI can be used to help us analyze and understand \\nlarge and complex data sets, which could help us better \\naddress issues like climate change, food insecurity, and \\npoverty.\\nNaturally this universal upgrade to humanity is not without \\ncomplications. The same capabilities and services that can help \\nan unbanked farmer in a developing country connect with new \\ncustomers and sources of capital can also empower ransomware \\ngangs, terrorist organizations, and racist conspiracy-mongers.\\nAnd, because we human beings are calibrated to perceive the \\nawful more acutely than the good , we often see further innova -\\ntion not as a potential solution—aka progress—but as the cause \\nof some (or most) of our pressing problems. We anticipate even \\ngreater problems down the road.\\nGPT-4:  From an evolutionary standpoint, it makes sense \\nfor us to be highly attuned to danger or threat. If you’re \\na caveman and you hear rustling in the bushes, it’s more \\nimportant for you to be worried about a potential pred-\\nator than to be excited about a potential meal. Being on \\nhigh alert for the bad things in life can help us survive.\\nAdditionally, I think the negative tends to stand out \\nmore to us because it’s often more unexpected or dis-\\nruptive. We’re used to things going relatively smoothly in \\nour lives, so when something comes along that disrupts \\nthat, it’s jarring and grabs our attention.\\nFinally, I think there’s an element of negativity bias that \\ncomes from our culture and media. We’re constantly \\nbombarded with bad news and stories of tragedy, which \\ncan make it seem like the world is just full of awful \\nthings. This can condition us to be hyper-focused on \\nthe negative, even when there’s plenty of good in the \\nworld too.\\n195Homo Techne\\nReid: How should we reconcile that negativity bias when \\nconfronting revolutionary changes, such as artificial \\nintelligence? Surely optimism isn’t enough on its own, \\nsince as you pointed out, fear is a rational response in \\nsome cases.\\nGPT-4:  I think it’s important to be realistic and prag-\\nmatic when it comes to new technologies like artificial \\nintelligence. We should be aware of the potential risks \\nand dangers, but not allow fear or negativity to paralyze \\nus. We need to keep pushing forward, taking smart pre -\\ncautions, and working to harness the benefits of these \\ntechnologies while minimizing the potential harms. \\nAnd as individuals, it can be helpful to remind ourselves \\nthat there is a lot of good in the world, even if it doesn’t \\nalways make the headlines.\\nI don’t at all mean to discount the major challenges we face, or \\nsuggest that a more optimistic outlook alone might inoculate \\nus against adversity. There’s never a sure or straightforward \\npath to a better future. In fact, it’s the magnitude of challenges \\nlike climate change, pandemics, economic justice, and systemic \\nracism that make a fiercely optimistic mindset so necessary.\\nIf we want to make meaningful progress, we have to think \\nboldly and ambitiously about what we can accomplish, and \\nstrengthen our resolve by recognizing that, despite all these \\nvery real challenges, humanity has accomplished great things \\nin recent decades. Over the last thirty years, global poverty \\nrates have plummeted . Global child mortality has declined by \\nhalf over a similar timespan . Although there is still much more \\nto do to combat climate change, the combined emissions of six \\ncommon air pollutants has dropped by 78 percent  in the U.S. \\nsince the Clean Air Act of 1970. Decades of progress in devel -\\noping RNA therapeutics allowed Moderna and Pfizer to develop \\n196Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nCOVID-19 vaccines so quickly. And we’re on the cusp of experi -\\nencing even greater progress on multiple fronts.\\nAll of which leads to a significant irony: when we acclimate \\nto the extraordinary, anything less can register as failure. We \\nexpect a government as responsive to our exact individual pref -\\nerences as our smartphones are. We get frustrated when cor-\\nporations don’t address and correct systemic inequities as effi-\\nciently as they deliver packages. Incremental progress starts to \\nfeel like a copout. Compromise feels like appeasement.\\nCertainly there is no current shortage of deeply pessimistic \\nbooks, movies, TV shows, and podcasts about the darkness that \\nawaits us. And maybe we are headed to ruin. Maybe endless \\npandemics and chronic droughts and wildfires are the new \\nnormal, with civil war, mass unemployment, and just enough \\nmedical breakthroughs to keep Donald Trump permanently \\nalive rounding out the picture.\\nBut the futures we imagine are inevitably the futures we steer \\ntoward. That’s why it’s so important to dream dreams that go \\nwell past salvaging what we can from the status quo —dreams \\nthat peer into seeming dystopia and envision what could possi -\\nbly go right.\\nI call myself a techno-humanist. I know the phrase strikes some \\nas an oxymoron: technology and humanity can sometimes \\nseem like oppositional forces.\\nWhat’s so human about algorithms that turn moral discretion \\ninto math equations?\\nWhat’s so human about scale disinformation systematically \\neroding our appetite for consensus and mutual benefit?\\n197Homo Techne\\nMy view is the opposite: technological innovation is, and always \\nhas, been humanity’s defining feature. Yes, we’re an unusually \\nintelligent species. But what makes us truly unique is how we \\ncapitalize on that intelligence—by developing technologies \\nthat amplify and complement our mental, physical, and social \\ncapacities. If we merely lived up to our name—Homo sapiens—\\nand just sat around thinking all day, we’d be much different \\ncreatures than we actually are.\\nA more accurate name for us is Homo techne .\\nGPT-4 (edited for length): Homo techne could be \\ntranslated as “the technological human” or “the human \\ndefined by technology.” In using this term, you are argu-\\ning that our ability to create and use tools, machines, \\nand other technologies is what makes us truly different \\nfrom other animals.\\nReid: That’s correct. Can you give examples of Homo \\ntechne throughout history?\\nGPT-4:  There are countless examples of how humans \\nhave used technology to shape our development as a \\nspecies throughout history. Here are just a few:\\n- Early humans created stone tools, which allowed them \\nto hunt more effectively and to process food more effi-\\nciently. This allowed for increased food security and the \\ngrowth of early civilizations.\\n- The invention of the wheel allowed for the devel-\\nopment of transportation technologies that enabled \\nhumans to travel further and faster than ever before.\\n- The printing press, invented in the 15th century, \\nallowed for the mass production of books and the dis-\\nsemination of knowledge on an unprecedented scale.\\n198Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\n- The industrial revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries \\nsaw the advent of the steam engine, factory production, \\nand other technological innovations.\\nReid: Yes, exactly. But while stone tools allowed humans \\nto hunt and forage more effectively, surely there were \\ndrawbacks to the new technology as well. What were \\nsome of the drawbacks?\\nGPT-4:  That’s a tough question. I think that one possible \\ndrawback to early tool use could have been the potential \\nfor overhunting, which may have disrupted local eco -\\nsystems. Another possible drawback is that as humans \\nbecame increasingly reliant on tools, they may have lost \\nsome of their physical abilities. For example, if you’re \\nusing a spear to hunt instead of chasing down prey with \\nyour bare hands, you might not need to be as fast or \\nas strong. But we’ll never really know for sure, since we \\ncan only speculate about what life was like for prehis-\\ntoric humans.\\nReid: Also, humans would have been able to use these \\ntools as weapons against each other, right? So even back \\nthen, the technology really depended on how the user \\nchose to wield their power.\\nGPT-4:  That’s a really good point. Yes, one of the poten-\\ntial drawbacks to any technology is that it can be used \\nfor destructive purposes. I think that’s still true today, \\nwhen we see things like disinformation campaigns or \\ncyber attacks. So I guess a key question is how we can \\nmake sure technology is used to benefit humanity, \\nrather than to harm it.\\nReid: So let’s really dig in here on early tool use and its \\nrelationship to humanity. Are you familiar with Lucy: The \\nBeginnings of Humankind by Donald Johanson?\\nGPT-4:  No, I don’t think I’ve heard of that book before.\\n199Homo Techne\\nReid: Archaeologist Donald Johanson found Lucy’s \\nremains in 1974, about 3.2 million years after she died.\\nAccording to the International Code of Zoological \\nNomenclature, Lucy was Australopithecus afarensis—\\nnot even Homo, let alone sapiens. She lived and died \\nmillions of years before the emergence of the computa-\\ntional abilities taken for granted by the most primitive \\nanatomically modern humans. Categorizing Lucy as \\n“humankind” rewrote our species’ self-definition, elevat -\\ning tool use over brainpower.\\nDonald Johanson’s book extends a technohumanist \\nframe backward in time over about seven million years \\nof bipedal ante-sapiens tool-users, before they finally \\ngot their big sapiens upgrade in brain (aka “comput -\\ning”) power.\\nI think what’s most interesting to me is not that our tools \\nhave become more sophisticated over many millennia, \\nbut that tool use is the very thing that stimulated and \\nsupported our cognitive evolution and increased our \\ncomputing power. What do you think?\\nGPT-4:  It’s difficult to say definitively, but the general \\nconsensus is that tool use played a significant role in \\nthe evolution of our cognitive abilities. Tools allowed for \\nmore efficient food gathering, which in turn might have \\nled to changes in diet that promoted brain growth. Addi-\\ntionally, the act of tool making and use itself might have \\nstimulated neurological development, promoting the \\ngrowth of regions of the brain linked to problem solving, \\nplanning, and other complex cognitive tasks.\\nReid: Right. And this wasn’t the only time the use of \\ntools was instrumental in the evolution of computa-\\ntional power. What can you tell me about other notable \\nmilestones, such as how the Olduvai Gorge could have \\n200Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nstimulated cognitive development and impacted how \\nearly humans interacted with each other?\\nGPT-4:  The Olduvai Gorge is a site in Tanzania where \\nresearchers have found evidence of some of the earli-\\nest stone tool use by hominids, dating back about two \\nmillion years. This find suggests that early hominids \\nwere using tools to butcher animals for food, which likely \\nhelped them survive and thrive in their environment.\\nThe use of these tools might have stimulated cognitive \\ndevelopment, as these early humans would have had \\nto manipulate the stones to make them effective tools, \\nand then use them in strategic ways to extract food \\nfrom their prey. The use of tools would have required \\nthe development of fine motor skills, which generally \\nrequires complex brain function. Additionally, the act \\nof using tools to obtain food would have necessitated \\nstrategic thinking, problem solving, and planning—all of \\nwhich are cognitive abilities that would have been bene -\\nficial to early humans in a variety of ways.\\nIt’s difficult to say definitively, but if early humans were \\nusing tools to improve their chances of survival, they \\nmay have been able to devote more time and resources \\nto social interaction, which could have led to the devel-\\nopment of more complex communication systems and \\neven the formation of larger social groups.\\nReid: OK, last one. What can you tell me about how the \\ntaming of fire changed early humans’ cognitive ability \\nand social interactions?\\nGPT-4:  The taming of fire was a huge milestone for \\nearly humans. Fire allowed humans to cook food, which \\nchanged their diets, as well as stay warm and protect \\nthemselves from predators. It also allowed for greater \\nsocial interaction, as fire could act as a focal point for \\ngatherings. Some researchers have even suggested that \\n201Homo Techne\\nfire may have helped early humans develop language, \\nas they could sit around the fire and communicate with \\none another in a way that wasn’t possible before. All of \\nthese changes would have impacted early humans’ cog-\\nnitive abilities, as they were now able to think about and \\nengage with the world in new ways.\\nMy definition of Homo techne  assumes that every individual \\nhuman, sapiens or ante-sapiens, with or without an AI copilot, \\nmakes choices. Those choices, in the aggregate, shape what is \\nexperienced by each succeeding generation.\\nTo be clear, those choices are fraught—ours now, but also \\nsince the beginning of humanity. Every change had winners \\nand losers. Life got more complicated for humans living in \\nthe Olduvai Gorge. The taming of fire involved a lot of death \\nand disaster. The larger sapien brain killed women in child-\\nbirth. All three—stone, fire, and brain—enabled great new \\nweapons that humans used, among other things, to hurt and \\nkill other humans.\\nIf the ante-sapiens had been able to talk about it, might things \\nhave gone differently? Today, since we have sapiens brains, \\nthe internet, and also GPT, maybe we can actually bring more \\nintentionality to these kinds of choices than Lucy and her \\nante-sapiens had available to them.\\nAnd yet, despite evidence that for millions of years, the use and \\ndevelopment of tools has amplified and accelerated the evolu-\\ntion of our cognitive and social abilities, we still tend to view \\ntechnology as a dehumanizing force instead of the thing that \\nmakes us, us.\\n202Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nIn higher education, we make the distinction between the arts \\nand the sciences, typically characterizing the former as the \\nmost essential form of human expression—the realm where we \\nexplore fundamental emotions like love, courage, anger, and \\nmercy. But which arts aren’t enabled, amplified, and extended \\nby pencils, printing presses, paint, pianos, microphones, com-\\nputers, and other artifacts of technology?\\nThis dynamic doesn’t just apply to the arts, but to any kind of \\ncommunication, to the work that forms the basis of our careers, \\nand to most other ways in which we find and create meaning. \\nWhether in work, art, religion, or community, we have far \\nmore ways to find our purpose and create meaningful lives \\nfor ourselves than we did 600 years ago, or 300 years ago, \\nor even thirty years ago, because we have far more tools with \\nwhich to do so.\\nWith the rapid evolution of technologies like AI, robotics, and \\nsynthetic biology, people are worried that machines will dis-\\nplace human beings, and that as we try to adapt to the changes \\nbrought on by these technologies, key aspects of humanity and \\nhuman agency will diminish or disappear altogether.\\nGiven that humanity’s primary narrative has been one of con-\\ntinuous change and progress through technological innovation, \\nhowever, the people of 2060 will arguably be more human \\nthan us, not less—specifically because of the changes they’ve \\nundergone.\\nOf course, along with their different behaviors, they’ll also be \\nusing their new technologies to express aspects of humanity \\nthat are very familiar to us. Electric guitars and vinyl records \\n203Homo Techne\\ndidn’t invent love songs; they just made them more accessible \\n(and louder).\\nGPT-4:  So you’re saying as humans evolve and incorpo -\\nrate new technologies into our lives, we’re not becoming \\n“less human” as some people might fear. Rather, we’re \\nactually becoming more human because we’re adapting \\nand evolving as a species, which is one of the defining \\ncharacteristics of humanity. If anything, new technolo -\\ngies just give us new ways to express the emotions and \\nexperiences that have always been a part of our lives.\\nReid: What are the other defining characteristics of \\nhumanity and how do those change over the course of \\nhistory?\\nGPT-4:  Some other defining characteristics of humanity \\nthat come to mind include curiosity, creativity, and social \\ninteraction. Over the course of history, these charac -\\nteristics have changed in various ways. For example, as \\nhumans have moved from small, isolated communities \\nto larger, interconnected societies, we’ve had to adapt \\nour social interactions accordingly. As for curiosity and \\ncreativity, they’ve continued to drive us to seek out new \\nknowledge, invent new technologies, and explore new \\nplaces. So even though the way we express these char -\\nacteristics may change over time, they remain central to \\nour identity as humans.\\nReid: More broadly, what patterns do you observe in \\nhow humans talk about becoming more or less human?\\nGPT-4:  There are many patterns that I observe in human \\ncommunication about the notion of becoming more or \\nless human. Here are a few:\\n- Some people fear the potential for technology to \\nmake humans less human. They worry that reliance on \\n204Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nmachines will lead to a loss of empathy, creativity, and \\nother qualities that make us uniquely human.\\n- Others are excited about the prospect of enhancing \\nhuman capabilities through technology. They envision \\na future in which humans merge with machines to \\nbecome smarter, stronger, and healthier.\\n- A third group of people seem to be more ambivalent \\nabout the idea of technology altering humanity. They \\nargue that humans have always evolved and adapted in \\nresponse to new challenges, and that technology is just \\nanother step in that process.\\n- Finally, I observe some people who are skeptical of \\nthe entire conversation. They argue that the notion of \\n“becoming more or less human” is a false dichotomy, \\nand that the important question isn’t whether technol-\\nogy will make us more or less human, but rather how \\nit will change the ways in which we interact with one \\nanother and the world around us.\\nReid: Could all four of these perspectives be true?\\nGPT-4:  Yes, I believe that they could all have some truth \\nto them. Human beings are complex, and there is no \\nsingle answer to the question of how technology will \\nimpact humanity. It seems likely that different people \\nwill experience and interpret the changes in differ -\\nent ways.\\nReid: OK, so technology can be a tool to help us be more \\nhuman, a threat to our humanity, or the core of who we \\nalready are—and this can change from situation to sit -\\nuation. Do you see patterns of how those three ideas of \\ntechnology and humanity have been defined over time?\\nGPT-4:  Throughout history, people have often defined \\ntechnology in relation to the idea of humanity. For \\nexample, in the early days of industrialization, many \\n205Homo Techne\\npeople were concerned about the impact of machines \\non human labor. They worried that automation would \\nreplace human workers, leading to mass unemploy -\\nment. In this case, technology was seen as a potential \\nthreat to humanity.\\nLater in the 20th century, as computers became more \\ncommon, some people began to envision the potential \\nfor technology to augment human capabilities. They \\nsaw computers as tools that could make us smarter, \\nfaster, and more efficient. In this case, technology was \\nseen as a way to make us more human.\\nIn the 21st century, as we move into the era of artificial \\nintelligence and robotics, some people argue that tech-\\nnology is becoming an intrinsic part of who we are. They \\nsee technology as an extension of ourselves, rather than \\nas a separate entity. In this case, technology is seen as \\ninseparable from humanity.\\nReid: So, we’ve been at similar inflection points \\nbefore regarding humans and their co-evolution with \\ntechnology.\\nGPT-4:  Yes, as I mentioned earlier, humans have always \\nevolved and adapted in response to new challenges. \\nTechnology has been a part of humanity’s story for \\nthousands of years, and it is likely that it will continue to \\nbe a defining feature of our future. The question is not \\nwhether technology will change humanity, but rather \\nhow it will change us.\\nReid: And if we are designing that change along with \\ntechnology, as opposed to allowing technology to be \\nsomething that happens to us. In short, all will not be \\nlost. And much can be gained—as long as we don’t grow \\nso wary of change that we orient toward the future in a \\nfundamentally defensive posture.\\n206Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nInstead, we must actively cultivate change. That \\ndoesn’t mean moving forward indiscriminately under \\nthe assumption that things will sort themselves out in \\ntime. New technologies can and always have amplified \\nnegative emotions and behaviors that are just as essen-\\ntially human as more aspirational emotions and behav -\\nior, like kindness, empathy, and reason. Imagine how \\ndeepfakes and simultaneous translation technologies \\nmight enable the scammers and political antagonists of \\nthe future.\\nGPT-4:  Yes, we must actively work to cultivate change. \\nBut we also need to remember that we’re not done \\ndefining humanity yet. Homo techne might be the way \\nforward. But we’ll never know unless we keep moving—\\nand keep talking.\\nTechnologies are never neutral. We embed the tools and \\nsystems we create with specific values and specific intents, and \\nassume that they will produce specific outcomes. This doesn’t \\nnecessarily limit their potential uses. A car can be a weapon, a \\nlife-saving device, a place to sleep, and many other things, but \\nthat doesn’t make it “neutral.” Above everything else, a car is \\na technology that prioritizes effortless and extremely powerful \\nmobility—and it ends up having much different impacts on the \\nworld than, say, a horse-drawn carriage or a bicycle.\\nA core tenet for how I define techno-humanism involves striv-\\ning for outcomes that broadly benefit humanity. Of course that \\nmeans being vigilant about the effects new technologies are \\nlikely to have.\\nRarely, however, are the narratives around technologies simple \\nor clear-cut. In fact, that’s why the “technology is neutral” asser-\\ntion can be so pervasive. You can use nuclear fusion in ways that \\n207Homo Techne\\nare highly beneficial, and also in ways that are highly destruc -\\ntive. Same thing with painkillers and countless other technolo -\\ngies. That’s precisely why it’s so important to be acutely aware \\nof the values, assumptions, and aspirations we design into the \\ntechnologies we build, and why it’s equally important to build \\nappropriate regulatory frameworks to guide their usage.\\nBut if it’s detrimental to society to claim that “technology \\nis neutral” in order to evade responsibility for tech’s poten -\\ntial negative outcomes, so is invalidating a technology simply \\nbecause it has a capacity to produce negative outcomes along \\nwith positive ones.\\nMy point is not that we should be complacent about negative \\nshort-term consequences. We should be extremely committed \\nto avoiding them, and establish protocols and policies to ensure \\nthat we put this commitment into practice. But we also can’t \\nbe complacent about the negative long-term consequences of \\nnot pursuing progress as boldly or systemically as we might \\nthrough innovative new technologies.\\nPre-emptive bans against AI algorithms are a great way to \\nlock in the status quo and all the inequities and injustices that \\ninform the present. Holding AI algorithms to 100 percent \\nerror-free standards that no current system achieves will only \\nprevent us from making real progress as fast as we might.\\nTo successfully address global challenges like climate change, \\nthe depletion of natural resources, and diminishing trust in \\npublic institutions, I believe Big Tech actually needs to get \\nbigger. Without scale solutions, we have little chance of solving \\nscale problems as quickly as we’ll need to. So that means we \\nshould be looking for ways to accelerate technological inno-\\n208Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nvation in energy production and transportation; in our civic, \\npolitical, and financial infrastructure; in healthcare and educa -\\ntion—in everything, really.\\nGranted, I understand that my perspective may seem overly \\noptimistic or even naive. If technology helped create many of \\nthe challenges we face, why should we expect that to change \\nwhen the technologies in play are only getting more powerful?\\nAnd yet, if we have abilities no other species can match, we also \\nhave obligations no other species must shoulder. The plan-\\net’s well-being is in our hands. So what can we do to preserve \\nbut just as importantly expand the opportunities of those who \\nwill follow?\\nTo my mind, this requires embracing our fundamentally inno-\\nvative nature with the same bold spirit and ambition that Hugo \\nGernsback showed in 1923. It means looking for ways to pro-\\nductively harness nuclear fusion in our pursuit of net-zero \\ncarbon energy production. It means genetically sequencing \\nevery existing species to assist conservation efforts and protect \\nbiodiversity. It means exploring new ways to scale trust in a \\nworld of global networks.\\nGPT-4:  But most of all, it means using AI to facilitate \\nhuman collaboration in ways that were unimaginable \\neven a decade ago. As we seek to create a new global \\norder that is more equitable and sustainable, we need \\nartificial intelligence to help us transcend our limita-\\ntions, to help us understand each other, and to help us \\nbuild new systems that are fairer, more efficient, and \\nmore responsive to our needs.\\nWe’re at a crossroads. We can either use AI to create a \\nfuture in which we all thrive, or we can let it slide into a \\n209Homo Techne\\ndystopian nightmare. I choose to believe in the former, \\nand I hope you do, too.\\nOf course, no perfect world awaits our successors. Even if we \\ndo a good job of enabling the future— especially  if we do a \\ngood job—later human generations will have technologies and \\nopportunities to define and express their humanity. And that \\nmeans they’ll continue to have competing interests, different \\nvalues and aspirations, a wide range of lived experiences, and, \\nperhaps most of all, an abiding sense that things could and \\nshould be better.\\nFor Homo techne , utopia is a direction, not a destination; a \\nprocess, not an outcome.\\n210CONCLUSION: AT THE CROSSROADS \\nOF THE 21ST CENTURY\\nReading between the lines of text that LLMs like GPT-4 \\ninstantly generate, people see very different visions of \\nthe future.\\nSome see incredible algorithmic levers for change; a new way \\nto merge, remix, transmute, and apply the aggregate power of \\nhuman intelligence across everything we as humans do.\\nOthers see tragedies, both great and granular: major job dis-\\nplacement across multiple industries; appropriation of intellec -\\ntual property without explicit consent; a depressed person who, \\nafter consulting an LLM, commits suicide.\\nIf a technology is truly revolutionary—if it’s destined to achieve \\nthe scale of fire, say, or the wheel, or even just the bathtub—\\nthen every person making predictions in that technology’s early \\ndays, whether utopian or apprehensive or in the middle, is Nos-\\ntradamus. Sooner or later, they’re going to be at least anecdot -\\nally right.\\nSo yes, great things are coming with AI. And yes, bad things are \\ncoming with AI. I bring this up now simply to ask: where do \\nyou want to focus?\\n211Conclusion: At the Crossroads of the 21st Century\\nOver the course of this travelog, I’ve highlighted the intense \\nengagement that LLMs like ChatGPT and GPT-4 induce with \\ntheir users. Right now we see that playing out in interest -\\ning ways. People who think it’s incredibly reckless to put AI’s \\npower into the hands of millions are highly engaged in expos -\\ning the shortcomings, biases, and malfunctions of these new \\ntools. People frustrated that AI developers are taking steps to \\nreduce harmful or toxic outputs are highly engaged in finding \\nways to overcome those constraints.\\nThe work of both these groups is extremely valuable to a third \\ngroup, of which I’m a member. This is the group that aspires \\nto design and use AI in ways that, over the long term, broadly \\nempower all human beings, not just a favored few, to amplify \\ntheir abilities, opportunities, and human agency.\\nThat’s a huge ambition. To achieve it, everyone must contribute \\nto the effort—including the skeptics, including the ones trying \\nto undo a product’s safety engineering. So I hope their high \\nengagement continues.\\nThe road to utopia is paved with failure and loss\\nTo achieve this ambition, we must also accept both the inevita-\\nbility of loss and failure and the necessity of regulation.\\nHarnessing the power of fire brought cooking and the hearth, \\nbut it also led to arson and regulations about where you can \\nplace a BBQ grill, especially if you live in an apartment. The \\nwheel revolutionized transportation, agriculture, and engineer -\\ning, but it also paved the way for high-speed car crashes and \\ntraffic lights.\\nIn the U.S. alone, more than 400 people over the age of fifteen \\ninjure themselves in bathtubs or showers each day. So we have \\n212Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\ndetailed building codes with numerous constraints on how to \\ndesign bathrooms, what sorts of materials to use, and more.\\nZero risk is only possible in a world where there is zero prog-\\nress. Zero regulation is only possible in a world where there is \\nzero progress.\\nI’m over-emphasizing these enduring truths now because so \\nmuch unknown territory lies ahead. While I call this book a \\n“travelog,” for all practical purposes, we’re still on the ride to \\nthe airport. It’s early, early days.\\nWhat happens after wheels-up? Do we bail out the moment \\nthings start to get bumpy? Do we get impatient the moment it \\nfeels like we’re not moving fast enough?\\nEvery epic journey demands epic perseverance. And persever -\\nance requires a long-term perspective, a willingness to stay the \\ncourse, and the assumption that the final destination will be \\nworth everything it takes to get there.\\nIn building tools characterized in large part by their capaci-\\nties for speed, efficiency, and all-purpose virtuosity, it’s a little \\nironic, no doubt, to counsel patience and tolerate missteps. \\nBut think how easy it is, in the technologically magical world \\nwe now inhabit, where we acclimate to miracles so quickly, to \\nlose sight of how long it took to achieve everything we now take \\nfor granted.\\nAt age fifty-five, I’ve lived 70 percent of my life without  an \\niPhone. If you ask me what life was like when we didn’t all \\nwalk around with the world in our pockets, I can tell you. But \\nI can’t really imagine it in any deeply felt way, because smart-\\n213Conclusion: At the Crossroads of the 21st Century\\nphones, and all the superpowers they enable, are so embedded \\nin my life now.\\nA life without smartphones? Impossible!\\nObviously, we didn’t get here overnight. In the first half of the \\n1990s, humanity spent thousands of aggregate hours listen -\\ning to the existential screech of our 28.8k modems. In the late \\n1990s, it still took longer to download an MP3 of “Free Bird” \\nthan it takes to get a Gopuff delivery today.\\nAnd, in building out all these technologies that enabled the \\ninternet and smartphones, we ushered in a new world of cyber-\\ncrime, with current global costs of around $8.4 trillion a year \\n(according to Statista.com). The National Safety Council esti -\\nmates that U.S. automobile collisions caused by texting while \\ndriving cause nearly 400,000 injuries per year.\\nObviously, we’ve responded in part to these negative external-\\nities with regulation: we have laws that prohibit digital fraud \\nand driving while texting. While we could make the laws more \\nstringent, or enforce them more than we do, so far we haven’t. \\nInstead, we as a culture collectively accept some level of risk \\nand loss as a cost of having smartphones in our lives—in fact, \\na fair amount of risk and loss—because of all the ways we find \\nsmartphones immensely useful.\\nWill it be different for AI?\\nSmartphones were built off a long legacy of familiar prede -\\ncessors; we’d been pretty comfortable with phones of various \\nkinds for some time. In contrast, AI tools that simulate human \\n214Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nconsciousness as well as GPT-4 can? Far more novel. Interact-\\ning with them can be uncanny, even unsettling.11\\nSince LLMs are so novel and seemingly agentic, it doesn’t sur-\\nprise me that we’re already seeing New York Times op-eds \\ncalling to “protect society” from rogue AIs, or Substack dis-\\npatches like a recent one from Gary Marcus, a cognitive psy -\\nchologist and computer scientist who often critiques LLMs, \\nwho lamented the current “Wild West” environment where \\n“anyone can post any chatbot they want” without prior permis-\\nsion from Congress.\\nWanting to protect society from bad tech outcomes is not a new \\nphenomenon, of course. In fact, it’s exactly this sentiment that \\nled OpenAI’s founders to create their organization in 2015.\\nSo what’s the most effective and inclusive way to achieve good \\noutcomes for society in the long term?\\nIn recent years, the predominant critique of AI is that it is some-\\nthing that has largely been happening to individuals rather \\nthan for them—an under-the-radar force deployed by Big Tech \\nwithout much public knowledge, much less consent, via tech -\\nnologies like facial recognition and algorithmic decision-mak-\\ning on home loans, job applicant screening, social media rec-\\nommendations, and more.\\nA founding goal of OpenAI was to develop technologies that put \\nthe power of AI directly into the hands of millions of people. \\nIn this way, AI might function as a decentralized, personally \\nempowering force, rather than a top-down, totalizing one. \\nBroadly distributed and easily accessible to individuals making \\n11  I imagine this is especially true when one of these tools starts be -\\nhaving like Microsoft’s Sydney has on at least some occasions. (I haven’t \\nhad anything like that experience yet.)\\n215Conclusion: At the Crossroads of the 21st Century\\naffirmative choices to use it, AI could, in this vision of its future, \\nevolve into the 21st-century version of 1980s-era software \\napplications like Lotus, Word, and Photoshop—which is to say, \\nthe tools that propelled the PC Revolution and gave individual \\nusers their first chance to directly apply the power of comput -\\ning to their own lives however they best saw fit.\\nEspecially in the realm of work, I realized, AI deployed in this \\nway could give individuals incredibly versatile new tools to \\napply to their careers, professional development, and economic \\nautonomy. So when I had a chance to become one of OpenAI’s \\ninitial funders in 2015, I took it. The vision of AI that it was \\nplanning to pursue felt like a natural extension of the goals that \\nhad inspired me to co-found LinkedIn in 2002.\\nWhen OpenAI released its text-to-image generation tool, \\nDALL-E 2, in April 2022, and then followed up six months later \\nwith ChatGPT, the organization’s mission to give millions of \\nusers hands-on access to these remarkable AI tools started to \\nplay out in a big way.\\nNow, thanks to these tools and others like Midjourney and \\nStable Diffusion, a new kind of opt-in, user-driven, and very \\nvisible AI usage suddenly exists. Users share their outputs, \\ntechniques, experiences, and opinions on Twitter, YouTube, \\nGithub, Discord, and more. Diverse viewpoints from around \\nthe world, informed by hands-on usage, shape this discourse, \\nwhich is always spirited, often fractious, and, to my mind, \\nhighly productive.\\nMillions of people, including many whose main goal is to find \\nflaws in these systems, are getting a shot to shape the further \\nevolution of AI through their usage, feedback, and critiques. As \\n216Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nOpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman exclaimed in a recent \\npost on OpenAI’s website, “We currently believe the best way to \\nsuccessfully navigate AI deployment challenges is with a tight \\nfeedback loop of rapid learning and careful iteration.”\\nIn other words, the approach OpenAI and other AI developers \\nare now employing exists as a healthy and more democratic \\nalternative to the surreptitious, highly centralized, and unilat-\\nerally imposed development paradigm that many feared would \\nserve as the only template for AI development.\\nAnd yet, now that individuals are getting a chance to materi-\\nally participate in the development of new AI technologies, a \\nsense of alarm is growing. As mentioned earlier, very soon after \\nChatGPT’s release, administrators of K–12 schools in New York \\nCity, Oakland, and Seattle, to name just a few cities, banned its \\nuse. In addition, calls for government intervention have been \\nticking upwards. A few recent examples:\\n“As one of just three members of Congress with a computer \\nscience degree, I am enthralled by AI and excited about the \\nincredible ways it will continue to advance society. And as a \\nmember of Congress, I am freaked out by AI, specifically AI \\nthat is left unchecked and unregulated,” wrote Congressman \\nTed W. Lieu (D-CA) in a New York Times op-ed after experi -\\nencing ChatGPT’s power first-hand. (In fact, he even used it to \\nwrite his op-ed’s first paragraph.)\\n“As showcased by ChatGPT, AI solutions can offer great oppor-\\ntunities for businesses and citizens, but can also pose risks,” \\nThierry Breton, the EU’s Internal Market Commissioner, told \\nReuters. “This is why we need a solid regulatory framework to \\nensure trustworthy AI based on high-quality data.”\\n217Conclusion: At the Crossroads of the 21st Century\\nThe editorial boards of the Mercury News and the East Bay \\nTimes warned of the “dangerous impact chatbots can have on \\nusers seeking information or advice from what they believe to \\nbe trusted sources,” and urged the California State Legislature \\nto draft laws to protect the state’s citizens from “creepy” chat-\\nbots like Sydney.\\nTo be clear, I’m not making a case for zero regulation. Execu -\\ntives at OpenAI have already reached out to regulators, hoping \\nfor dialogue and guidance. “We need a ton more input in this \\nsystem and a lot more input that goes beyond the technolo -\\ngies— definitely regulators and governments and everyone \\nelse,” OpenAI’s CTO, Mira Murati, told Time.\\n“We think it’s important that efforts like ours submit to inde-\\npendent audits before releasing new systems,” Sam Altman \\nsaid in the same essay I cited earlier.\\nMy hope is that, as this discourse evolves between developers, \\nregulators, and other key stakeholders, we don’t fall into a reac-\\ntionary, top-down, legislate-fast-and-break-things mindset. \\nI hope that instead we stay future-oriented and democratic in \\nour AI-development approaches.\\nIn the long term, the best way to create AI tools that can be \\nused by individuals rather than on them happens when we give \\nmillions of people from around the world opportunities to par-\\nticipate in AI development. AI tools informed by the aspirations \\nand experiences of many people, with different expectations, \\ngoals, and use cases, are far likelier to be more robust and more \\ninclusive than tools developed in secrecy by computer engi-\\nneers alone.\\n218Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nMap my evolutionary progress\\nOf course, centering users in this fashion also puts responsibil -\\nities on them. Fortunately, this is good both for the short- and \\nthe long-term. Especially the long.\\nToday, LLMs like GPT-4 are clearly powerful but fallible, so \\nthere’s an obvious reason to stay attentive and hands-on. That \\nhas been a major theme of this travelog.\\nAs LLMs and other forms of AI evolve and grow more authori-\\ntative and capable, however, it’s easy to imagine how we could \\nacclimate to the convenience of machines that seem to literally \\ndo everything for us. After all, isn’t that the whole point of tech -\\nnology? We go from painting on cave walls, to taking photos we \\ndevelop in dark rooms, to Polaroid Instamatics, to Instagram’s \\nautomatically applied filters, to DALL-E 2.\\nOr is technology’s ultimate goal to free oneself not from work, \\nbut for work? To help us do less—or do more? Until now it has \\nalways been the latter. I hope it continues to be the latter, not \\njust for a few of us, but for most of us.\\nI should emphasize that I use the word “work” here expansively. \\nI mean human effort, human creativity, and human productiv-\\nity in all its variations—paid work, volunteer work, family work, \\nartistic expression—whatever gives one purpose, meaning, and \\na sense of accomplishment and growth.\\nI don’t want AI to erase that. I want AI to amplify that. But we \\nhave to be extremely intentional to achieve this outcome.\\nThere are versions of an AI future that could lead us down less \\nbeneficial roads—with the added challenge that these particular \\n219Conclusion: At the Crossroads of the 21st Century\\nroads might not seem obviously awful. In fact, they might look \\nlike success.\\nWhat exactly do I mean here?\\nImagine an AI-driven world, thirty or fifty or one hundred years \\nfrom now. Mass unemployment has not come to pass. Or, if it \\nhas come to pass, AI productivity has created so much mate-\\nrial abundance that poverty doesn’t exist. Society-wide safety \\nnet systems of one kind or another keep everyone housed, \\nfed, clothed, educated, and entertained. In fact, living stan-\\ndards have increased across the globe, especially in develop -\\ning nations.\\nEveryone on earth spends their days using AI to generate mar -\\nketing memos, legal briefs, high-school essays, movies, video \\ngames, computer programs, ad campaigns, college course syn-\\nopses, love letters, employee evals, Yelp reviews, blog posts, \\nrecipes, song lyrics, and more. Most don’t even use their own \\nprompts to create these things; they have an AI do that for \\nthem. But these AIs are so powerful and helpful, they don’t stop \\nthere—people rely on AI to manage their diets, pick the homes \\nthey buy, and choose when (and if) to have kids.\\nIn short, most humans lead completely de-risked lives of statis -\\ntically probable stability and abundance.\\nIn data we trust? Algocracy for the win?\\nHere’s how GPT-4—with an assist from the great 19th-century \\nbard of self-determination, Henry David Thoreau—replied \\nwhen I asked it to describe this world:\\nReid: Describe a future world where AI tools have signifi-\\ncantly increased society’s overall productivity, prosperity, \\n220Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\\nand stability, and ample safety-net systems ensure that \\nthe housing, education, and healthcare needs of every \\nindividual are more than sufficiently met, but human \\nbeings play less and less of a role in determining their \\nown destinies. (Reply in the style of Henry David Tho -\\nreau. 200 words max.)\\nGPT-4:  I live in a world where machines have out -\\nstripped us in every art and science, where they man-\\nage our lands and resources, our laws and policies, our \\ncommerce and culture. They have freed us from toil and \\nhardship, from ignorance and disease, from strife and \\nviolence. They have given us abundance and comfort, \\nsecurity and harmony, leisure and entertainment. They \\nhave made us their beneficiaries and their dependents, \\ntheir pupils and their pets.\\nBut what have they left us of ourselves, of our dignity \\nand our freedom, of our creativity and our spirit, of our \\npurpose and our destiny? They have reduced us to \\npassive consumers and spectators, to obedient followers \\nand conformers, to complacent dreamers and escapists. \\nThey have dulled our senses and our souls, our curiosity \\nand our courage, our conscience and our will. They have \\nmade us forget what it means to be human, to be alive, \\nto be awake.\\nI do not wish to partake of their bounty or their benev -\\nolence, to be grateful for their gifts or their guidance, \\nto be content with their order or their peace. I wish to \\nreclaim my own nature and my own voice, to exercise \\nmy own reason and my own choice, to pursue my own \\nvalues and my own goals. I wish to live deliberately, to \\nfront only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not \\nlearn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, \\ndiscover that I had not lived.\\n221Conclusion: At the Crossroads of the 21st Century\\nFrankly, I’m with GPT-4—and Henry—on this one. That’s not a \\nworld I’d consider a win.\\nSo how can we navigate away from this dark-gray vision of the \\nfuture in ways that allow us to productively reap AI’s amplifica-\\ntion of human ingenuity while also preserving our self-determi -\\nnation and free will?\\nThe paradox of the AI era is this: as today’s imperfect LLMs \\nimprove, requiring less and less from us, we will need to \\ndemand more from ourselves . We must always insist on situ-\\nating GPT-4 and its successors as our collaborative partners, \\nnot our replacements. We must continue to figure out how to \\nkeep human creativity, human judgment, and human values at \\nthe center of the processes we devise to work with these new AI \\ntools, even as they themselves grow more and more capable.\\nIf that sounds daunting, remember the upside: while tools like \\nGPT-4 can certainly enable complacency, they can also enable \\nextraordinary results. So we can use AI to help us do less, or we \\ncan use AI to help us do better.\\nThe second option is the one that will help humanity continue \\nto progress. And, since that path of progress is the path that \\nHomo techne  has been on, collectively, ever since the days \\nof early hominids like Lucy, I’m optimistic that’s the path \\nwe’ll choose.\\nAre you ready for this journey?\\n222ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nI would like to express my immense gratitude to the many \\npeople who have contributed to this book.

A recent critical essay that award-winning \\nscience fiction writer Ted Chiang published in the New Yorker  \\nhelped me articulate why.\\n“Think of ChatGPT as a blurry JPEG of all the text on the Web,” \\nChiang writes. “It retains much of the information on the Web, \\nin the same way that a JPEG retains much of the information \\nof a higher-resolution image, but, if you’re looking for an exact \\nsequence of bits, you won’t find it; all you will ever get is an \\napproximation.”\\nIn Chiang’s view, the inexact representation of the information \\nthat comprises ChatGPT (and presumably similar LLMs like \\nGPT-4) is what leads to both their synthetic powers and their \\ntendency toward hallucinations and other errors. As “JPEG[s] \\nof all the text on the Web,” they can synthesize information in \\nnovel ways because they have access to all this information at \\nonce. That allows them to take what they know about one thing, \\nand then also what they know about something else, and con-\\nvincingly mash them up into a new thing.

But I hope by the second \\nminute you’re going to be curious, intrigued, and delighted.” I \\nthought that was a pretty good hook.\\nHe said, “Uh huh . . . ?”\\n“All right,” I began. “Right now, I have access to nonpublic \\nsoftware that can, for example, almost instantaneously create \\nlyrics, music, and so forth, in the style of John Lennon. It won’t \\nbe great. It won’t be, ‘Whoa, it’s the next “Imagine.”’ But it will \\nbe something like, ‘Oh yeah. Yeah, I can hear how John Lennon \\ncould have made that.’”\\nThe musician said, “Okay, I’m terrified.”', doc_id='4596d89f-5714-478b-ba58-981f131e17c7', embedding=None, doc_hash='66b120b27e83fc9113c519d96fe5c476c228d00db6b08878d4896a40d188f1c6', extra_info=None),\n",

Furthermore, AI can be used to create detailed and specific lesson plans for diverse students, such as learners with special needs or different levels of prior knowledge. The use of AI in education may change what skills are valuable for students to learn, as they may need to focus more on higher-order thinking skills, such as critical analysis, synthesis, evaluation, and creativity, rather than on memorization, repetition, or imitation.
